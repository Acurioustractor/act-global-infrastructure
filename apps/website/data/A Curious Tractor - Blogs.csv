A Hero's Journey from Addiction to Inspiration: The Life of Vireak,a-heros-journey-from-addiction-to-inspiration-the-life-of-vireak,64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc5c,657b8a4f4d058245f3956811,false,false,Thu Dec 14 2023 23:05:51 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Sat Nov 23 2024 06:52:36 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Sat Nov 23 2024 07:19:50 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<p id="""">In the heart of Sydney's Cabramatta, a young boy named Vireak embarked on a journey that seemed predestined by the shadows of his environment. His early life was marked by the pervasive presence of heroin, crime, and gangs, a setting that held a powerful sway over his destiny. The absence of stable, positive role models and the frequent encounters of his family with the law, especially his mother's involvement in running drugs set the stage for his initial descent.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/657b8be04b17a8859cebac01_382598581_18384975727039599_682268933282277987_n.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt=""""></div><figcaption id="""">""An asian kid growing up in NZ with aspirations to play for the All blacks.""</figcaption></figure><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Vireak's path initially mirrored the environment he was born into. Driven by necessity and addiction, he found himself drawn into the world of drug dealing, a decision more about survival than choice. This lifestyle became a relentless cycle, one where every attempt to break free seemed to pull him back with even greater force. His life became a testament to the adage, ""With drugs or any addiction, it's constantly gone round in circles.""</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">But within Vireak, there lay a dormant strength, an untapped potential for change. This strength was the catalyst for a series of transformations that would redefine his existence. Unlike many hero tales, Vic's mentor was not a person but his own realisation and decision to change. ""I chose to make a change,"" he asserts, marking a pivotal moment in his journey. It was the inner awakening, the self-mentorship that guided him towards a different path.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Setting goals became Vireak's beacon through the tumult. He envisioned a life where he could be a personal trainer, a better father — aspirations that offered a stark contrast to his past. These goals were not merely dreams; they were the milestones he set on his journey towards redemption.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/657b8bf2ff89734c90972b54_329216198_1691993094588387_7876016469552139779_n.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Two waterfalls 💦 in one day with the Kendall’s.Wentworth falls and Minnie Haha falls, in the Blue mountains.⛰️</figcaption></figure><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Vireak's trials were numerous, battling not just addiction but the societal stigma attached to his past. Yet, he persevered, bolstered by the resilience within him. He realised that the true battle was against giving up. In his words, ""There's bad habits but it’s when you give up, that's when it consumes you."" His ordeal was his continuous fight against relapse and maintaining the course of his new life. This was not a singular battle but an ongoing war against his past demons and societal expectations.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">As Vireak navigated through these challenges, he began to see the value of his experiences. He understood that his journey could serve a greater purpose. His past, once a source of pain and struggle, became a tool for mentorship. ""Your story is going to impact a lot more lives than it would just burning inside you,"" he reflected. This realisation marked his transition from a life marked by adversity to one of guidance and inspiration.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">The relationship with his mother, once strained by the challenges of crime and drug involvement, evolved into a solid bond, underpinned by mutual understanding and shared experiences of transformation.

Back in the eighties and nineties, it was a place rooted in heroin, crime, and gangs. This environment shaped me, but it also trapped me.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">My descent into crime wasn't something I'm proud of, but it felt like the only way to survive. Moving from one women's refuge to another, with my mom being a prolific drug dealer at the time, only added to the chaos. I probably started using heroin when I was 14; it was everywhere, and it became a way to cope with my dark feelings. Life was hard, filled with constant challenges and few escapes. As I grew older, I found ways to support my habits, and so I started selling drugs.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">The struggle with addiction is hard to describe unless you've been through it. I felt like I was constantly going in circles, always pulled back by the strong tug of the drugs. But what I tell the boys is, don't stop trying to quit. There are bad habits, but it’s when you give up that they consume you. That was my reality, a never-ending cycle of addiction.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">My time in youth detention and prison was a harsh reality check. There, I faced the consequences of my actions head-on. The cold bars and isolation made me reflect on my life choices. I don't look back on that part of my life fondly, but it was crucial for my change. The days and nights spent there were filled with introspection and a growing resolve to turn my life around. Funnily enough, I don’t think the punishment itself was what turned me around; it was getting over the lifestyle of drug addiction and constant chasing that forced my hand. I was just over it.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">I chose to make a change... I was set for failure in my mind. From my teachers to my family and community, the only thing I saw, heard, and felt was that Vireak is a loser. I believed that for a long time, but changing my mindset led to changing my health, wellbeing, and life.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Talking about my family, especially my relationship with my mom and brother, is complex. My mom, who was involved in running drugs, and I have come a long way. We've rebuilt our lives, leaving behind the crime and drugs. My brother, however, is a different story. He's still in jail, in and out over the years. I use my brother as part of the stories I tell the boys because I chose to make a change, and he kept doing the same thing over and over again. It's tough to talk about, but it's a reality that shapes my message to the kids I mentor.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Telling this story is tough. But when I share it, I see the impact it has. My story will impact more lives than if I kept it inside. People will always judge you, no matter what, and that continues to be tough, but I keep trying. Sharing my journey isn't just about me. It's about helping others see that change is possible, no matter where you come from.""</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Lot's of love</p><p id="""">Vireak</p>","This post delves into the life of Vireak, a man who grew up in the challenging environment of Cabramatta, Sydney, in the 1980s and 1990s.

Despite the pain of her passing, her spirit and lessons remain with us.</p><p id="""">Ros was a beacon of light in our community. Despite experiencing homelessness, she dedicated her life to helping others. I had the privilege of spending a significant amount of time with Ros, documenting her story for a campaign with Orange Sky. But our connection didn't end there. Ros stayed involved, speaking at events, giving interviews, and continuing to advocate for those less fortunate.</p><p id="""">One indelible memory that will forever remain with me is of the times I would take one of my daughters to buy flowers from Ros. It was more than a social visit; it was an opportunity for my daughter to meet a brave woman who embodied resilience, passion, and the human spirit. These visits opened up conversations about homelessness, resilience, and the power of compassion. After Ros's funeral, being able to discuss her life and legacy with my daughter was profoundly moving. I am grateful to Ros and the people in her life for gifting us these special moments and a story that my daughter can carry with her throughout her life.</p><p id="""">Ros's funeral was a testament to her impact. Hundreds attended, from those in homelessness services to local community businesses, and even those who were, like her, doing it tough. As I sat there, watching photos I had taken of her flash across the screen, accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful melody, I felt a profound sense of gratitude. I had been given the opportunity to experience Ros's energy, her passion, and her unwavering dedication to helping others without expecting anything in return.</p><p id="""">Ros was a fighter. She stood up for her friends, penned letters advocating for change, and faced the repercussions of her actions with courage. She lived her life the best way she knew how, even when it meant facing fines and backlash.</p><p id="""">Her voice, often discounted due to her history and rebellious spirit, cut through the noise. It reached higher levels, demanding attention and change. But was it respected enough? Was it heard by those who could enact the change she so passionately fought for?</p><p id="""">Losing Ros has left me in a state of introspection. I'm grappling with my role in social and systemic change. I feel a mix of confusion and anger, but also a deep sense of purpose. Ros's spirit has left an indelible mark on me. It's not just about the story we told for a campaign, but the lessons I learned from her about sacrifice, about fighting for what you believe in, and about the true cost of change.</p><p id="""">So, I ask you, what does it mean to have people like Ros supporting better decisions? How can we ensure their voices are not just heard, but acted upon? As I navigate this journey, I am reminded of Ros's resilience. Her story serves as a stark reminder that we must continue to fight, to listen, and to amplify the voices of those who are often overlooked. Because in their stories, we find the raw, beautiful truth of humanity.</p><p>‍</p>","I've been wrestling with whether to share this story. It's personal, raw, and still very fresh.

AI dangers,ai-dangers,64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc5c,688f16dea1a40ca73fa36388,false,true,Sun Aug 03 2025 07:59:26 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Sun Aug 03 2025 07:59:43 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,"<p id=""""># Flipping the Power: Empathy Ledger, AI and Community-Owned Solutions</p><p id="""">## 1. The Current Landscape: AI, Philanthropy, and Colonial Legacies<br>### 1.1 The Hinge Point: AI's Role in Grantmaking<br>The philanthropic and social investment sectors are currently at a critical juncture, largely influenced by the increasing integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into their core processes. A significant and growing portion of grant applications and subsequent reports are now drafted with the assistance of AI tools. While this technological adoption undeniably enhances operational efficiency by streamlining the creation of written content, it concurrently introduces a substantial risk: the potential **separation of funding decisions from genuine human relationships and lived experiences**. The concern is that if funding allocations become predominantly driven by the linguistic polish and structural fluency of proposals—qualities that AI can readily optimize—then communities possessing profound, context-rich knowledge but lacking the dedicated time or resources for extensive paperwork may find themselves increasingly marginalized. The pivotal question, therefore, transcends the mere adoption of AI, as its use is already an established reality. Instead, the central inquiry must focus on **who ultimately benefits from these AI-shaped processes**. Will AI be leveraged to amplify the inherent wisdom and agency of communities, or will it inadvertently automate and perpetuate a colonial pattern of extracting valuable stories and data, only to channel funds back to the same large, well-resourced organizations that are already adept at navigating complex application systems? This moment demands a conscious choice about the direction of travel for philanthropy in the age of AI.</p><p id="""">### 1.2 The Colonial Residue in Grantmaking<br>Conventional grantmaking practices, despite their intentions, often perpetuate structurally top-down dynamics that can inadvertently reinforce colonial legacies. These practices typically involve lengthy and complex application forms, narrowly defined standards of ""evidence"" that may not accommodate diverse knowledge systems, short funding cycles that hinder long-term planning, and competitive rounds that, by design, pit community groups and neighbors against one another in a scramble for limited resources. Within the Australian context, this operational model has historically and consistently sidelined Indigenous organizations and grassroots community initiatives, which may operate under different temporalities, prioritize relational accountability over bureaucratic compliance, and express their knowledge and impact in ways that don't conform to Western evidentiary norms. Furthermore, media representations and political narratives frequently compound this harm. When externally designed ""solutions,"" often imposed without genuine community co-design or ownership, fail to achieve their stated outcomes, the blame is often misplaced onto the communities themselves. This deflects critical scrutiny away from the underlying power dynamics inherent in the funding relationship and the often ill-suited metrics used to measure success, which may have distorted the initiative from its inception. The core issue lies in the **format of engagement becoming the de facto gatekeeper**. When this occurs, individuals and groups closest to the challenges and possessing the most relevant insights are forced to expend significant energy translating their lived realities and deep understanding into a language and structure dictated by the funder, a process that can feel alienating and extractive. The advent of AI in this space risks turbocharging this ""translation machine,"" further privileging form over substance, volume of data over depth of context, and speed of processing over the crucial element of informed, ongoing consent. Without deliberate intervention and a reorientation of values, the philanthropic sector may increasingly reward procedural compliance and polished presentation over genuine relationship-building, authentic understanding, and community-led innovation.</p><p id="""">The potential for AI to exacerbate existing colonial residues in grantmaking is particularly concerning when considering the specific challenges faced by Indigenous communities in Australia. The Australian Council of Learned Academies (ACOLA) report on AI and Indigenous Data Sovereignty highlights how AI models trained on incomplete or biased data can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and inaccurate representations . A stark example cited is the use of census data to estimate the number of ""hour-minute individuals"" within Indigenous populations, a metric criticized for failing to capture the rich diversity and complexities of Indigenous Australian lives and circumstances . If such flawed data and metrics are used to train AI systems involved in grant assessment or resource allocation, the outcomes could be deeply detrimental, further entrenching disadvantage and misdirecting funds. The report underscores that data is not neutral; it is a socio-cultural artifact reflecting the biases and perspectives of its collectors and interpreters . When AI systems are designed and trained without the active involvement and oversight of Indigenous communities, they risk replicating and scaling these biases. This is a critical concern for philanthropy, as AI-driven decision-making could lead to a situation where funding is allocated based on algorithmic outputs that are disconnected from the lived realities and priorities of Indigenous peoples. The emphasis on quantitative data and standardized metrics, often favored by AI systems for their ease of processing, can overlook the qualitative, narrative, and relational aspects of community well-being and impact, which are often central to Indigenous understandings of success. Therefore, without a deliberate and concerted effort to decolonize AI and data practices within philanthropy, the sector risks perpetuating a system where AI becomes a tool for more efficient extraction and marginalization, rather than a means of empowering communities and supporting self-determination.</p><p id="""">### 1.3 Resisting the ""Inevitability"" Myth (Tristan Harris)<br>Tristan Harris, a prominent voice in the discourse on technology's societal impact, offers a crucial critique of what he terms **""inevitability narratives""** surrounding technological advancements like AI. These narratives propagate the idea that the trajectory of an AI-driven future is preordained and immutable, leaving individuals and institutions with no rational alternative but to accelerate their adoption and adaptation to keep pace. Harris argues that such a fatalistic outlook actively erodes human agency and collective capacity to shape our future. This narrative becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: the belief that AI's dominance is ""inevitable"" fuels a perceived necessity to ""keep up,"" and the collective rush to adopt further solidifies AI's pervasive influence, thereby making it appear even more inevitable . However, Harris emphasizes that **we still possess agency and the power of choice**. We are not passive recipients of a technologically determined fate. Instead, we can, and must, design and implement **""relational guard-rails""**—ethical frameworks and operational protocols that prioritize human well-being, dignity, and accountability. This involves, for instance, advocating for a slower, more deliberate deployment of AI in areas where the potential for harm is significant, ensuring that diverse communities are integral to the governance structures of AI systems, and steadfastly prioritizing safety, cultural appropriateness, and robust accountability mechanisms. Within the philanthropic sector, this translates directly into championing **relationship-centred funding models**. In such models, the quality of conversations, the integrity of consent processes, and the recognition of community decision-rights hold far greater weight than the mere technical polish of machine-assisted grant applications or reports. It calls for a shift from a compliance-oriented approach to one that values and nurtures genuine partnership and mutual learning.</p><p id="""">Resisting the inevitability narrative, as championed by Tristan Harris, empowers philanthropy to establish ""relational guard-rails"" around the use of AI . These guard-rails are not about halting progress but about ensuring that technological advancement aligns with human values and community well-being. In practical terms, this translates to a more cautious and considered approach to AI adoption, particularly in areas where the potential for harm is significant. For philanthropy, this means slowing down the deployment of AI in grantmaking processes where it might automate bias or depersonalize crucial interactions. It involves actively including diverse communities, especially those historically marginalized, in the governance and oversight of AI systems used in funding decisions. Prioritizing safety, dignity, and accountability becomes paramount, moving beyond mere technical efficacy to consider the broader social and ethical implications. Harris's critique encourages funders to shift from a transactional mindset, where AI is seen as a tool for optimizing existing processes, to a relational one, where technology serves to deepen human connection and understanding. This means fostering funding models where conversations, informed consent, and community decision-making rights are valued more highly than machine-polished proposals or algorithmically derived impact metrics. By consciously choosing to implement AI in ways that enhance, rather than replace, human judgment and relational integrity, philanthropy can play a vital role in shaping an AI-driven future that is more equitable and just. This proactive stance is essential to ensure that AI serves as a tool for genuine social good, rather than an instrument that inadvertently reinforces existing inequalities.</p><p id="""">## 2. Centering Indigenous and Relational Knowledge<br>### 2.1 Indigenous Philosophies as an Antidote<br>Indigenous knowledge systems and philosophies offer profound and practical alternatives to the often abstract, transactional, and data-centric approaches that can dominate contemporary institutional practices, including philanthropy. Core principles such as **connection to Country (land, waterways, and skies), the centrality of Kinship (complex relational networks and responsibilities), the imperative of Custodianship (stewardship and care for all living things), and the practice of Reciprocity (mutual exchange and balance)** are not merely ""soft"" cultural values or abstract ideals. Rather, they represent deeply embedded operational principles that have sustained communities and ecosystems for millennia, fostering resilience, adaptability, and holistic well-being. When these Indigenous philosophies are thoughtfully and respectfully applied to funding practices and the development of AI systems, they facilitate a fundamental shift in authority and power dynamics. Authority is relocated to those who possess **local, relational knowledge**—the nuanced, context-specific wisdom that is often transmitted through story, ceremony, and lived experience, and which rarely conforms to standardized checkboxes or quantitative metrics. This form of knowledge, however, reliably guides effective action and sustainable outcomes because it is grounded in deep, intergenerational understanding of specific places and communities. Embracing these philosophies means moving beyond a purely extractive model of data collection and grantmaking towards one that honors interconnectedness, respects protocols, and recognizes the inherent value of diverse ways of knowing and being. This approach can transform AI from a tool of potential homogenization and control into an instrument for amplifying community voice, preserving cultural heritage, and supporting self-determined futures.</p><p id="""">The integration of Indigenous philosophies into philanthropic practices, particularly in the age of AI, offers a powerful antidote to the dehumanizing and extractive tendencies that can arise from purely data-driven approaches. The emphasis on **Country** encourages a holistic understanding of well-being that encompasses the environment, community, and culture, challenging reductionist metrics that focus on isolated outputs. **Kinship** principles underscore the importance of relationships, trust, and mutual respect in all interactions, countering the transactional nature of many grantmaking processes. **Custodianship** reframes the role of funders and communities alike as stewards of resources and knowledge, with a responsibility to future generations, rather than mere consumers or producers. **Reciprocity** ensures that the flow of resources and benefits is mutual, fostering partnerships based on equity and shared purpose, rather than dependency. These principles, when genuinely embraced, can transform AI from a potential tool of abstraction and control into a supportive mechanism for amplifying community wisdom and facilitating self-determined development. For example, AI tools could be designed to support the mapping and strengthening of kinship networks, or to monitor the health of Country according to Indigenous ecological knowledge, always under the guidance and control of the community. This approach contrasts sharply with AI systems that might extract data for external analysis and decision-making, often without the full understanding or consent of the community. By grounding AI development and deployment in these relational values, philanthropy can help ensure that technology serves to deepen connections, enhance local capacities, and support Indigenous self-determination, rather than undermining it.</p><p id="""">### 2.2 Decolonising AI and Data Practices: Sovereignty and Consent<br>The process of decolonising artificial intelligence and data practices necessitates a foundational commitment to designing for **Indigenous sovereignty and free, prior, and informed consent** from the very outset of any project or initiative. This means fundamentally rethinking who holds the authority to decide how knowledge is collected, who has the right to access and use that knowledge, for what purposes, and critically, how any benefits derived from that knowledge—be they economic, social, or cultural—are equitably shared and flow back to the communities from whom the knowledge originated. It requires a move away from extractive data practices, where information is often taken from Indigenous communities with little regard for their protocols or perspectives, and towards models that recognize and uphold Indigenous data governance. This includes respecting Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) rights, which encompass a wide range of traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, and biological resources. A crucial aspect of this decolonizing approach is the acceptance of **story as a valid and vital form of evidence**. In many Indigenous contexts, and indeed in many community settings globally, narrative is the primary and most reliable vehicle for conveying complex context, ethical considerations, historical understanding, and systems of accountability. Stories carry the nuances of lived experience, the wisdom of intergenerational learning, and the cultural frameworks that shape community values and aspirations. Therefore, integrating and respecting storytelling as a legitimate form of data and evidence is paramount for creating AI systems and funding models that are truly equitable, culturally safe, and responsive to community needs and priorities. This shift challenges the dominance of purely quantitative or Western-centric forms of evidence and opens space for a richer, more holistic understanding of impact and value.</p><p id="""">Decolonizing AI and data practices is an essential undertaking if these technologies are to serve, rather than undermine, Indigenous communities and their aspirations for self-determination. At its core, this process involves a fundamental shift in who holds power and how decisions are made regarding the collection, ownership, use, and dissemination of data and knowledge. It means designing AI systems and data governance frameworks from the outset that prioritize **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** (IDS) and the principle of **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent** (FPIC). IDS asserts the right of Indigenous peoples to govern the data ecosystems related to their communities, territories, and resources. This includes control over data creation, access, analysis, interpretation, and the ability to derive benefits from its use. FPIC requires that consent be sought and granted voluntarily, without coercion, before any data-related activities commence, and that this consent is based on a clear and comprehensive understanding of the purpose, scope, and potential implications of those activities. Decolonizing data practices also necessitates a critical examination of the epistemological foundations of AI. Many AI systems are built upon Western scientific paradigms that may not align with, and can even conflict with, Indigenous ways of knowing, understanding the world, and representing knowledge. Therefore, decolonization involves creating space for and valuing diverse knowledge systems, including Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies, in the design and application of AI. This might involve co-designing AI tools with Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous languages and protocols into AI interfaces, and ensuring that AI models are trained on data that is not only accurate and culturally relevant but also ethically sourced and managed.</p><p id="""">### 2.3 The Empathy Ledger: Narrative Sovereignty in Practice<br>The **Empathy Ledger** concept proposes a transformative approach to managing and valuing community narratives, positioning stories not as raw material to be extracted and commodified, but as **inherent assets owned and controlled by their tellers**. This framework seeks to operationalize narrative sovereignty, ensuring that individuals and communities maintain agency over their own stories and how they are used. Practically, the Empathy Ledger would function as a system that, first and foremost, **captures transcripts of stories with the explicit, informed, and ongoing consent of the storytellers**. These narratives are then intrinsically linked back to their originators, who are recognized as the primary sources and custodians of this knowledge. A core feature of the Empathy Ledger is the provision of robust **permissions and consent controls**, allowing storytellers to specify precisely where, how, by whom, and for what purposes their narratives may be utilized. Crucially, this consent is not a one-time agreement but can be revisited and modified by the storyteller at any point. Furthermore, the Empathy Ledger facilitates **relational attribution and fair compensation** when stories are used to inform proposals, develop training materials, support advocacy campaigns, or influence policy decisions. This ensures that the value generated from these narratives is shared equitably with those who shared their knowledge and lived experiences. In an era increasingly characterized by synthetic media and the potential for misinformation, the Empathy Ledger also serves as a **root of trust**, providing a verifiable provenance trail that anchors narratives to accountable individuals and their specific contexts. Beyond its technological aspects, the Empathy Ledger is envisioned as an **economic and ethical infrastructure**. Its aim is to redirect value towards those who are doing the essential, often undervalued, work within communities—such as youth justice mentors, disability advocates, carers, and Elders—thereby ensuring that **story becomes a genuine pathway to self-determination and community empowerment, rather than a commodity that is extracted, exploited, and ultimately forgotten**. This model directly counters the colonial habit of taking without consent and giving little or nothing in return, fostering instead a system of reciprocal respect and benefit.</p><p id="""">The **Empathy Ledger** is conceived as a practical and ethical infrastructure designed to operationalize the principles of narrative sovereignty, particularly in contexts where stories and lived experiences are shared, such as in grant applications, community consultations, or impact reporting. At its core, the Empathy Ledger treats personal narratives not as free-floating data points or raw material for extraction, but as **assets owned by their tellers**. This foundational principle shifts the power dynamic, ensuring that the individuals and communities sharing their stories retain control and agency over how their knowledge is used. Practically, the Empathy Ledger would function as a system that, with informed consent, captures transcripts or recordings of stories and securely links them back to their storytellers, establishing them as the recognized and respected source of that knowledge. This system would provide robust permissions and consent controls, allowing storytellers to specify how, where, and by whom their narratives may be used, and critically, to change these permissions at any time. This dynamic consent model is crucial in an era where data can be easily replicated and repurposed, often without the original contributor's knowledge or ongoing agreement. The Empathy Ledger aims to make these controls transparent and accessible, empowering storytellers to manage their narrative assets proactively.</p><p id="""">Beyond consent management, the Empathy Ledger is designed to enable **relational attribution and fair compensation**. When stories shared through the Ledger are used to inform proposals, train AI models, develop advocacy campaigns, or shape policy, the system would facilitate appropriate attribution to the storytellers and, where applicable, ensure they receive fair compensation for the value their narratives create. This moves away from the common practice of extracting stories for institutional benefit without adequately recognizing or rewarding the source. Furthermore, in an age of proliferating synthetic media and deepfakes, the Empathy Ledger could serve as a **root of trust**, providing a verifiable provenance trail that anchors narratives to accountable individuals and their specific contexts. This helps to combat misinformation and ensures that authentic voices can be distinguished from machine-generated or maliciously altered content. The Empathy Ledger is not merely a technological solution; it is an **economic and ethical infrastructure** intended to rebalance power and move value towards those who are often on the front lines of social change—youth justice mentors, disability advocates, carers, Elders—and whose lived experiences provide invaluable insights. By ensuring that storytellers retain sovereignty and share in the value generated from their narratives, the Empathy Ledger aims to make story a genuine pathway to self-determination and community empowerment, rather than a commodity to be extracted, exploited, and forgotten. This approach seeks to transform the relationship between funders, institutions, and communities, fostering a more equitable and respectful exchange of knowledge and resources.</p><p id="""">## 3. Australian Indigenous-Led AI: Case Studies and Frameworks<br>### 3.1 Healthy Country AI: Co-designed AI for Land Management<br>The **Healthy Country AI** program stands as a significant and inspiring example of Indigenous-led AI development in Australia, specifically focused on empowering Indigenous land and sea managers in remote northern regions . This initiative, backed by a substantial **$2.6 million investment**, aims to mobilize cutting-edge digital technology, including artificial intelligence, to support these communities in monitoring and caring for their Country . A core principle of the program is **co-design**, which involves Indigenous rangers working collaboratively with scientists and technology specialists to learn and apply new, inclusive AI and digital skills tailored to their specific needs and cultural contexts . The emphasis is on digital inclusion, ensuring that the development and application of these technologies deliver tangible environmental, cultural, and economic benefits to local Indigenous communities and enhance their existing land management practices . Ricky Archer, CEO of NAILSMA (North Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Alliance), a key partner in the initiative, highlights that while digital technology can transform land management, it should not replace the fundamental connection to Country; rather, new technologies must support and add value to this connection . The program builds upon existing collaborative work, such as that with Bininj Traditional Owners in Kakadu National Park tackling wetland weeds, Wik Traditional Owners and rangers managing threats to turtles on Cape York Peninsula, and Normanby Land Management reducing sediment flows to the Great Barrier Reef . This initiative is supported by a consortium of partners including the Telstra Foundation, Microsoft, and the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship program, underscoring a commitment to enhancing digital skills in line with traditional Indigenous knowledge systems . The CSIRO also highlights this program as a world-first, award-recognized effort that mixes ethical AI and modern science with Indigenous knowledge to deliver practical conservation solutions on Indigenous lands . The recent **$2.6 million funding boost** is specifically aimed at providing on-ground training for local Indigenous communities and land managers, enabling them to drive and develop AI and digital tools themselves for evidence-based decision-making on Country . This focus on Indigenous leadership in both the development and application of AI is critical for ensuring that these technologies serve community priorities and foster digital inclusion, offering valuable job and on-country enterprise opportunities . The Kakadu National Park case study further illustrates the success of this co-design approach, where a digital dashboard was developed to present AI data using the Bininj seasonal calendar, ensuring its relevance and usability for Traditional Owners and rangers in their adaptive management of Nardab floodplain . This collaborative monitoring and testing of knowledge ensured that healthy Country assessments were trusted and effectively used by the community .</p><p id="""">The Healthy Country AI program, co-developed with Traditional Owners, is a pioneering Australian initiative that empowers Indigenous communities to manage their lands using digital technology, including AI and drones , . The program's core aim is to survey culturally and ecologically significant species and habitats by blending ethical AI, modern science, and Indigenous Knowledge. It operates under key principles of Traditional Owner governance, reflecting local community priorities and supporting on-ground adaptive management . A notable success includes work with Bininj Traditional Owners in Kakadu National Park, where AI-assisted data from drone monitoring helped rangers effectively manage invasive para grass, leading to a significant increase in magpie geese populations—from 50 to 1,800 in one wetland within nine months , . Another project with Wik Elders and Aak Puul Ngantam (APN) Cape York rangers used AI to analyze images for monitoring turtle nesting sites, resulting in a up to 90% reduction in feral pig predation on nests , . This program exemplifies how AI can be a tool for Indigenous-led conservation and land management when developed ethically and collaboratively. The Healthy Country AI program is a collaborative effort involving the North Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Alliance (NAILSMA) and CSIRO, with support from partners including The Telstra Foundation, Microsoft, the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (NESP) Resilient Landscapes Hub, and the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship program . This partnership enables local Indigenous organizations, such as Aak Puul Ngantam, Normanby Land Management, and Kalan Enterprises, to work with scientists and technology specialists. Together, they learn about and utilize inclusive AI and digital skills to monitor the health of their country. The program emphasizes digital inclusion, co-designing a digital skills training program intended to deliver environmental, cultural, and economic benefits for local Indigenous communities and land management practices . This initiative builds upon existing work, such as the collaboration with Bininj Traditional Owners in Kakadu National Park tackling wetland weeds and Wik Traditional Owners and rangers managing threats to turtles. The program focuses on developing operational monitoring programs through deep collaboration in technology development and the accompanying training programs . Kalan Enterprises, for instance, has committed to embedding these new approaches to monitoring and reporting into their daily operations, highlighting the program's practical impact .</p><p id="""">A significant aspect of the Healthy Country AI program is its focus on empowering Indigenous rangers to drive and develop AI and digital support tools themselves, fostering evidence-based decision-making on their Country . This approach not only supports the vital work Indigenous rangers are already doing but also helps to fill a critical gap by providing them with the skills to design, drive, and use these technologies. These digital skills can also open up valuable job and on-country enterprise opportunities for Indigenous people . The program's commitment to co-design is central, ensuring that the development of AI tools is deeply intertwined with Indigenous leadership and priorities. For example, in the Kakadu National Park project, the digital dashboard was designed to present AI data using the Bininj seasonal calendar, making it more accessible and usable for Traditional Owners . This integration of Indigenous knowledge systems into the AI tools themselves is a hallmark of the program. The initiative also emphasizes ethical data collection and management, ensuring that Traditional Owners govern the data and that it reflects community priorities . The success of these projects, such as the significant increase in magpie geese populations and the reduction in turtle nest predation, demonstrates the power of combining Indigenous knowledge with culturally responsible AI . The ANU School of Cybernetics, in its work with Healthy Country AI, developed a novel data privacy framework reflecting how the community manages access to knowledge . This involved integrating traditional knowledge, such as the Bininj six-season calendar, into the algorithms and data management systems. The ""Strategy Planner"" tool, developed as part of this engagement, allows rangers to compare the outcomes of different management strategies in an interactive dashboard, supporting their decision-making rather than prescribing actions . This approach underscores the need for new ontologies for AI design that respect cultural contexts and empower local communities. The program's success in Kakadu, where Indigenous-led science combining AI with traditional knowledge was named a Eureka Prize finalist, showcases the potential of such partnerships to inspire other Indigenous groups to find appropriate ways to use technology for environmental management . The collaboration involves Kakadu Traditional Owners and Indigenous rangers, CSIRO, Microsoft, Parks Australia, The University of Western Australia, and Charles Darwin University, demonstrating a multi-stakeholder approach to supporting Indigenous-led AI .</p><p id="""">### 3.2 Digital Dilly Bag: Indigenous Data Sovereignty in Action<br>The **""Digital Dilly Bag""** project, undertaken by Tranby Aboriginal Co-operative Limited, stands as a significant Australian example of an Indigenous-led initiative directly addressing the critical need for Indigenous Data Sovereignty . Funded through an auDA community grant, this project aims to create a secure digital hub specifically designed for the preservation of Indigenous knowledge in a culturally sensitive and appropriate manner . The core objective is to capture and store the vital stories of Elders and communities, ensuring they are not lost and can benefit current and future generations . More than just an archive, the Digital Dilly Bag project seeks to develop a framework that allows First Nations communities to govern the collection, ownership, and application of their cultural knowledge . This initiative explicitly positions itself as a demonstration of an Indigenous-led and controlled ""safe keeping place"" for digital data, intending to create a blueprint for sovereign data capabilities that can be adopted by communities across Australia . The project's emphasis on community control and culturally sensitive data management directly aligns with the principles underpinning the Empathy Ledger, showcasing a practical, on-the-ground effort to empower Indigenous communities in the digital age. The use of the term ""dilly bag,"" a traditional Indigenous carrying vessel, symbolically represents the project's purpose as a container for precious cultural knowledge, managed and protected by its rightful owners.</p><p id="""">The Digital Dilly Bag project's commitment to Indigenous Data Sovereignty is further evidenced by Tranby Aboriginal Co-operative's existing work in digitizing its significant archival collections. They are implementing the **Mukurtu digital archives system**, a platform developed with and for Indigenous communities worldwide to manage, share, and preserve digital heritage in culturally relevant and ethically minded ways . Mukurtu, a Warumungu word meaning 'dilly bag' or 'safe keeping place for sacred materials,' emphasizes Indigenous community empowerment and control over their cultural information, contrasting sharply with traditional colonial archival practices that have often ignored Indigenous protocols and concerns . This existing infrastructure and philosophical alignment with Mukurtu's principles suggest that the Digital Dilly Bag project will be deeply grounded in established best practices for Indigenous data management. The project aims to safeguard some of Australia’s most significant Aboriginal political history and cultural heritage, making it accessible to the Indigenous community nationally while respecting traditional protocols . By focusing on creating a demonstrable example of an Indigenous-led and controlled data repository, the Digital Dilly Bag project directly contributes to the broader movement for Indigenous Data Sovereignty, offering a tangible model for how communities can assert control over their knowledge and narratives in the digital realm. This initiative provides a powerful case study for philanthropists looking to support Indigenous-led solutions that address the complex challenges of data ownership, cultural preservation, and self-determination in the 21st century.</p><p id="""">### 3.3 Cape York Turtle AI Project: Blending Traditional Knowledge and AI<br>A compelling example of Indigenous-led AI application in Australia is the project on Cape York, where Traditional Owners and scientists have collaboratively employed artificial intelligence and traditional ecological knowledge to protect endangered turtle nests . This initiative focuses on safeguarding baby turtles by using real-time information and location tracking, enabling Indigenous rangers to intervene and prevent predators from attacking the nests. The project exemplifies a successful fusion of cutting-edge technology with deeply rooted local knowledge systems, demonstrating a model where AI serves as a tool to enhance, rather than replace, Indigenous stewardship of Country. The ITU article ""Indigenous-led tech solutions for a better planet"" highlights this project as an instance where AI is being used to address critical ecological challenges by empowering local communities with data-driven decision-making capabilities . This approach not only contributes to biodiversity conservation but also reinforces the role of Indigenous peoples as primary custodians and protectors of their lands and waters. The success of this project underscores the potential for AI to be integrated into Indigenous land and sea management practices in a way that is culturally appropriate, community-driven, and effective in achieving environmental outcomes. The emphasis on real-time data allows for adaptive management strategies, ensuring that interventions are timely and targeted, thereby increasing the survival rates of the turtle hatchlings. This case study serves as an important model for how AI can be leveraged to support Indigenous-led conservation efforts globally, particularly in remote areas where traditional monitoring methods can be challenging and resource-intensive. The collaboration between Indigenous landowners and scientists also points to the importance of equitable partnerships in the development and deployment of AI for environmental management.</p><p id="""">The Cape York turtle project, as detailed in the ITU article, showcases a practical application of AI that aligns with Indigenous principles of caring for Country . By combining AI-driven data collection and analysis with the deep, place-based knowledge of Indigenous rangers, the project creates a powerful synergy. The AI component likely involves sensors or drones to monitor nesting sites and detect potential threats, while the rangers' traditional knowledge informs the interpretation of this data and the most effective, culturally appropriate response strategies. This model ensures that technology is not imposed from the outside but is instead adapted to serve the specific needs and priorities of the Indigenous community. The project's focus on protecting turtle nests is significant, as turtles hold cultural importance for many Indigenous groups in Australia and are also key indicators of ecosystem health. The ability of AI to provide real-time information empowers rangers to act swiftly, a crucial factor in mitigating predation, which is a major cause of hatchling mortality. This initiative is a testament to the innovative ways Indigenous communities are adopting and adapting new technologies to address long-standing environmental challenges. It also highlights the critical role of Indigenous knowledge in guiding the ethical and effective use of AI in ecological contexts. The success of such projects often depends on the establishment of trust and genuine collaboration between Indigenous communities and scientific institutions, ensuring that data sovereignty and cultural protocols are respected throughout the process. The Cape York example provides a strong argument for increased investment in Indigenous-led AI initiatives that prioritize both environmental outcomes and community empowerment.</p><p id="""">### 3.5 Dr. Terri Janke's ""True Tracks"" Framework for Ethical AI<br>Dr. Terri Janke, a Wuthathi, Yadhaigana, and Meriam woman and a leading expert on Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP), offers critical insights into the intersection of ICIP and artificial intelligence. She emphasizes that for Indigenous peoples, the advancement of technology is less important than whether these advancements are respectful, empower cultures, and avoid commodifying or marginalizing Indigenous knowledge and heritage . While AI presents opportunities in areas like language revitalization, land management, and health innovation, Dr. Janke cautions that it often operates without the necessary cultural or ethical grounding required by Indigenous knowledge systems . A significant concern is the development of AI tools without Indigenous participation, which can perpetuate systemic biases and lead to harm through uninformed decision-making, particularly in sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and the justice system. These biases can deepen existing inequalities and fail to respect cultural protocols or the collective custodianship inherent in ICIP . Dr. Janke poses a crucial question: ""Will we allow it [AI] to deepen the wounds of colonisation, or will we harness it to empower Indigenous peoples and cultures?"" .</p><p id="""">To address these challenges, Dr. Janke highlights the importance of robust frameworks for Indigenous engagement and data sovereignty. She specifically mentions the Maiam nayri Wingara Indigenous data sovereignty principles and her own **""True Tracks®"" framework** as essential guides for best-practice Indigenous engagement with AI and other technologies . The True Tracks® framework is built upon ten core principles: respect, self-determination, consent &amp; consultation, interpretation, cultural integrity, secrecy &amp; privacy, attribution, benefit sharing, maintaining Indigenous culture, and recognition &amp; protection . These principles provide a comprehensive roadmap for ensuring that AI development and deployment involving Indigenous knowledge are conducted ethically and in a manner that upholds Indigenous rights and interests. Dr. Janke calls for leadership and collaboration across all sectors to create systems that honor Indigenous knowledge and empower First Nations communities. This includes demanding transparency from AI platforms, supporting Indigenous-led initiatives, and advocating for the ethical use of AI in all spheres of influence . The goal is to ensure that AI is used to elevate, rather than erase, Indigenous cultures . The Arts Law Centre of Australia, referencing Dr. Janke's work, outlines specific ways AI can negatively impact ICIP rights. These include failing to attribute Traditional Knowledge holders, creating false and misleading representations, disregarding cultural protocols (such as those governing who can share certain stories or use specific artistic styles, including gender-specific artworks), misappropriating ICIP without consultation or Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), and leaving ICIP unprotected when included in AI-generated materials . Another significant concern is the generalization or homogenization of Aboriginal culture by AI programs, where unique designs and styles specific to language groups or Countries are blended into a generic ""Aboriginal artwork"" due to the broad data sources used for training AI models . This highlights the critical need for frameworks like True Tracks® that emphasize the communal nature of ICIP, which is tied to cultural heritage and Country, contrasting with Western copyright's focus on individual authorship . The call for Indigenous data sovereignty—control over how Indigenous data is created, stored, shared, and used—is central to protecting these rights in the age of AI .</p><p id="""">Dr. Terri Janke, a Wuthathi, Yadhaigana and Meriam woman, is an international authority on Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) and its intersection with artificial intelligence (AI) . Her work, particularly the ""True Tracks®"" framework, provides a critical foundation for developing and implementing AI in ways that respect and empower Indigenous communities. Dr. Janke emphasizes that for Indigenous peoples, the advancement of technology is not solely about innovation but about whether these advancements are respectful, empower cultures, and avoid commodifying or marginalizing Indigenous knowledge and heritage . She highlights that while AI can offer positive contributions, such as in language revitalization, land management, and health innovation, it often operates without the necessary cultural or ethical grounding inherent in Indigenous knowledge systems . This lack of grounding can perpetuate systemic biases and lead to harm, especially when AI tools are developed without Indigenous participation, impacting areas like healthcare, education, and the justice system .

This document emerged from a gathering of over forty Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers, practitioners, community members, and allies in January 2025 at the Centre for Global Indigenous Futures, Macquarie University, Sydney . The communique is pivotal as it directly articulates Indigenous perspectives on the development and application of Artificial Intelligence, grounded in the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty, Indigenous Protocols for AI, and Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) . This foundational approach asserts that Indigenous peoples are the ultimate authority over their knowledge and data, irrespective of where it is held or how it is used, and possess the inherent right to govern its use appropriately . The gathering aimed to explore how AI can be harnessed to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and support their thriving futures . The existence of such a communique, with its explicit grounding in Indigenous governance principles, provides a strong, collective Indigenous voice on AI, which is crucial for informing philanthropic investment and public policy. The participants, including notable figures like Dr. Terri Janke, signify the depth and credibility of the discussions and the resulting visions .</p><p id="""">The communique, published in the *Journal of Global Indigeneity*, represents a formal output of these deliberations, spanning eight pages . Its keywords—Artificial Intelligence, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, AI futures, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty—clearly indicate its scope and relevance to the discourse on community-owned AI solutions . The fact that it is an open-access document, with a DOI (10.54760/001c.133656) and ISSN (2651-9585), ensures its accessibility to a wider audience, including philanthropists and policymakers . The communique's focus on ""envisaging"" and ""imagining"" AI futures suggests a proactive and aspirational approach, rather than a purely reactive one. This aligns with the need to move beyond deficit narratives and towards empowering, community-driven innovation. The emphasis on Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) is particularly critical, as it directly addresses the power imbalances inherent in data collection and use, a core concern for the Empathy Ledger concept. The communique likely outlines specific principles, priorities, and perhaps even cautionary notes or recommendations for the ethical development and deployment of AI in ways that serve Indigenous communities' self-determined goals. For philanthropists, this document serves as a direct insight into the collective aspirations and concerns of Indigenous Australians regarding AI, offering a roadmap for supporting initiatives that are truly Indigenous-led and aligned with these envisioned futures. The call within the communique for people to take its contents seriously underscores the participants' desire for tangible impact and systemic change, moving beyond tokenistic engagement .</p><p id="""">The ""Envisioning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander AI Futures Communique"" is a critical resource for understanding the practical application of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) principles in the context of Artificial Intelligence in Australia . The gathering that produced it brought together a diverse group of Indigenous experts and allies, ensuring that the resulting visions are grounded in real-world experience and community needs . The communique explicitly states that its conversations were ""grounded in Indigenous Data Sovereignty, Indigenous Protocols for AI and Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property principles"" . This grounding is not merely theoretical; it has direct implications for how AI projects should be conceptualized, developed, and governed. For instance, the principle that ""Indigenous peoples are always the authority for their knowledge and data wherever it is held and used, and have the right to determine its proper governance"" directly supports the core tenets of the Empathy Ledger, which seeks to give storytellers control over their narratives . Philanthropists looking to support Indigenous-led AI initiatives can use this communique as a guide to ensure their funding aligns with these established Indigenous governance frameworks. The document likely elaborates on what ""empowerment"" and ""thriving"" mean in the context of AI from an Indigenous perspective, potentially offering specific use cases or areas of focus, such as language preservation, cultural heritage management, land and sea management, health, education, or economic development, all through an Indigenous AI lens.</p><p id="""">The significance of this communique also lies in its potential to challenge mainstream, often Western-centric, narratives about AI development and its ""inevitable"" trajectory. By presenting a collectively envisioned Indigenous AI future, it offers an alternative pathway, one that prioritizes community well-being, cultural integrity, and self-determination . The participants' hope that their work will be taken seriously and not dismissed highlights a common challenge faced by Indigenous knowledge systems when interacting with dominant paradigms . For philanthropists, engaging with this communique is an opportunity to demonstrate a genuine commitment to Indigenous leadership and to move beyond superficial consultations. It can inform the development of funding criteria that explicitly require adherence to Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles and the involvement of Indigenous communities in the governance of AI projects. Furthermore, the communique could serve as a foundational document for capacity-building initiatives aimed at equipping Indigenous communities with the knowledge and tools to engage with AI on their own terms. The document's status as a refereed journal article also lends it academic credibility, making it a valuable resource for advocacy and policy influence . The detailed list of participants, including representatives from various organizations and institutions, indicates a broad consensus and a significant collective effort behind the communique's creation .</p><p id="""">## 4. Theoretical Underpinnings: Academic Perspectives<br>### 4.1 Cognitive Imperialism in AI: Counteracting Bias with Indigenous Epistemologies<br>The rapid advancement and proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various sectors have brought to light significant epistemological shortcomings, primarily stemming from the dominance of Western paradigms in its development. This oversight, termed **""cognitive imperialism"" in AI**, results in the systematic marginalization of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and the operationalization of biases against non-white, non-male, and non-Western peoples , . Cognitive imperialism manifests when AI systems, shaped by data and perspectives predominantly from Western contexts, implicitly embed and propagate certain worldviews, often to the exclusion or devaluation of others. This is particularly problematic for Indigenous communities whose rich, complex knowledge systems, developed over centuries and encompassing unique understandings of the natural world, medicine, agriculture, and societal organization, are frequently overlooked . The consequence is not merely a theoretical concern but has practical implications, leading to AI solutions that can be culturally insensitive, less effective, or even detrimental when applied in Indigenous contexts, as they may not align with local realities and needs , . The very algorithms that drive AI, often perceived as neutral and universal, can inadvertently reinforce cultural hegemony by reflecting the knowledge and cultural perspectives of their designers, who are, in most cases, not Indigenous .</p><p id="""">Addressing cognitive imperialism requires a fundamental shift in how AI is conceptualized and developed. It involves more than just diversifying datasets or development teams; it necessitates a deep engagement with Indigenous epistemologies to rebuild AI's foundational principles . This includes questioning the underlying assumptions that guide AI development and actively seeking to integrate diverse sources of knowledge. The paper ""Cognitive imperialism in artificial intelligence: counteracting bias with Indigenous epistemologies"" proposes a novel methodology for this integration, emphasizing a participatory approach that includes Indigenous perspectives from the outset . This framework is grounded in principles of participatory design, co-creation, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS), aiming to diversify AI’s conceptual and development processes, thereby enriching it with cognitive and cultural plurality . Key elements of this methodology include co-creation with Indigenous communities, establishing ethical protocols for Indigenous data governance, and adapting AI algorithms to better reflect and respect Indigenous ways of knowing . The goal is to move beyond mere inclusion to recalibrate the epistemic foundations of AI, fostering technologies that are equitable, contextually relevant, and culturally sensitive, thereby upholding the sovereignty and dignity of Indigenous knowledge . The ""Abundant Intelligences"" research agenda, referenced in the context of counteracting cognitive imperialism, further exemplifies this Indigenous-led approach , . This international, interdisciplinary program seeks to reimagine AI based on Indigenous Knowledge (IK) systems, drawing on the rich plurality of these systems to transform AI from a tool that can reinforce colonial practices (exclusion, extraction, manipulation, eradication) into an ""engine of abundance"" that supports community flourishing and care for the world . The argument is that current AI development suffers from fundamental epistemological shortcomings because it is largely rooted in Western rationalist epistemologies that exclude many ways of knowing. This exclusion means that current AI cannot adequately, robustly, or humanely conceptualize intelligence . By fully engaging with AI and exploring how different conceptions of intelligence (rooted in IK systems) can be embodied in these technologies, the ""Abundant Intelligences"" program aims to rebuild AI’s epistemological foundations. This approach is not just about mitigating harm but about actively creating AI that serves Indigenous futures and, by extension, offers more robust and ethical AI for all of humanity. The integration of diverse knowledge systems is thus presented not only as a moral imperative but as a crucial step for developing AI technologies that are universally beneficial and ethically robust .</p><p id="""">The academic paper ""Cognitive imperialism in artificial intelligence: counteracting bias with indigenous epistemologies"" by Ofosu-Asare et al. (2024) provides a critical theoretical framework for understanding the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of AI and Indigenous knowledge systems , . The authors argue that the dominant Western epistemological paradigms in AI development lead to ""cognitive imperialism,"" where Indigenous knowledge systems are sidelined, resulting in AI systems that are biased, culturally insensitive, and potentially detrimental to Indigenous communities . This perspective is crucial for understanding why initiatives like the Empathy Ledger are necessary, as they seek to counteract these power imbalances by centering Indigenous narratives and sovereignty. The paper proposes a methodology for integrating Indigenous epistemologies into AI development through participatory design, co-creation with Indigenous communities, ethical protocols for Indigenous data governance, and the adaptation of AI algorithms to reflect diverse ways of knowing , . This approach directly supports the core tenets of the Empathy Ledger, which emphasizes community ownership and control over narrative assets. The paper highlights that the exclusion of Indigenous perspectives results in AI systems that may misinterpret or fail to acknowledge Indigenous realities . This can manifest in various ways, from AI-generated art that misrepresents Indigenous cultures &nbsp;to AI tools used in public services that perpetuate biases against Indigenous peoples. The authors advocate for a decolonized approach to AI development, which involves recognizing the value of Indigenous knowledge systems and ensuring they are integral to the design and function of AI systems, rather than being merely supplemental . This involves a shift from a purely data-driven approach to one that incorporates relationality, context, and the holistic understanding characteristic of many Indigenous epistemologies. The framework proposed in the paper emphasizes co-creation with Indigenous knowledge holders, embedding ethical considerations specific to Indigenous cultures (such as data sovereignty and respect for intellectual property), establishing Indigenous data governance, integrating Indigenous epistemologies into AI algorithms, ensuring cultural sensitivity in AI applications, and adopting a multidisciplinary approach . These components provide a robust theoretical and practical roadmap for developing AI technologies that are more equitable, contextually relevant, and culturally sensitive.</p><p id="""">### 4.2 ACOLA Report: AI and Indigenous Data Sovereignty (Walter &amp; Kukutai)<br>The Australian Council of Learned Academies (ACOLA) report, ""Artificial Intelligence and Indigenous Data Sovereignty,"" authored by Professor Maggie Walter (Palawa) and Professor Tahu Kukutai, provides a critical examination of the intersection between AI technologies and the rights of Indigenous peoples in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand concerning their data . The report underscores that while AI innovation and adoption can bring economic value and efficiency, Indigenous populations may not equally share these benefits and instead face risks of bias, stigmatization, and issues of accountability. A core argument is that AI and machine learning are heavily data-dependent, and this data is not merely electronic but possesses cultural, strategic, and economic value, which increases with technological advancements. Consequently, questions of data ownership, usage, access, and decision-making authority are of paramount concern for Indigenous communities globally . The report highlights that algorithms and data are not neutral; they inherently reflect the knowledge and cultural perspectives of their designers and the data generators. In most instances, these creators are not Indigenous, leading to AI systems that may not align with, or may even undermine, Indigenous worldviews and priorities .</p><p id="""">The ACOLA report strongly advocates for the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS), a global movement asserting Indigenous peoples' rights to govern the creation, collection, ownership, and application of their data, as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) . In the Australian context, the Maiam nayri Wingara Indigenous Data Sovereignty Collective, in collaboration with the Australian Indigenous Governance Institute, issued a communique from their 2018 national conference demanding Indigenous decision-making and control over the entire data ecosystem, including creation, development, management, analysis, dissemination, and infrastructure . Similarly, in Aotearoa New Zealand, the Te Mana Raraunga Māori Data Sovereignty Network champions Māori rights and interests in data, emphasizing data quality and integrity, and utilizing ""tikanga"" (Māori ethical and customary practices) to protect and share knowledge for collective benefit . The report emphasizes that for AI to be equitable, Indigenous peoples must be decision-makers regarding the use or deployment of their data, including in social program algorithms . This requires a shift from current practices where AI often perpetuates knowledge extraction from Indigenous communities without their consent or benefit . The report also touches upon the potential benefits of AI for Indigenous communities, although it notes these are not its primary focus. Examples include the use of AI in language revitalization, such as Te Hiku Media's development of speech recognition and natural language processing tools for te reo Māori, and Indigenous tech entrepreneurs like Mikaela Jade using augmented and mixed reality to share stories in Indigenous communities . However, the central message is that realizing these benefits is intrinsically linked to Indigenous leadership and governance, ensuring that the application, timing, and context of these technologies are determined by Indigenous peoples themselves . The ACOLA report serves as a foundational document for understanding the unique challenges and imperatives at the intersection of AI and Indigenous rights in Australia. It calls for greater scrutiny of AI's impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures and for the establishment of coalitions to ensure AI empowers rather than exploits First Nations communities . This involves advocating for binding standards, regulations, and laws to protect Indigenous knowledge and ensure its use only occurs with Indigenous consent .</p><p id="""">The Australian Council of Learned Academies (ACOLA) report on Artificial Intelligence and Indigenous Data Sovereignty, authored by Professor Maggie Walter (a Palawa woman and Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the University of Tasmania) and Professor Tahu Kukutai (Ngāti Tiipa, Ngāti Kinohaku, Te Aupōuri, Professor of Demography at the National Institute of Demographic and Economic Analysis, Aotearoa New Zealand), provides a critical examination of the implications of AI for Indigenous peoples in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand . The report underscores the inherent risks when AI systems are developed and deployed without a thorough understanding of Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) principles. A central theme is the potential for AI to perpetuate and even amplify existing colonial biases and inequalities if it relies on flawed, incomplete, or historically skewed data about Indigenous communities. The authors argue that data is not a neutral entity; rather, it is imbued with the context of its creation and can reflect the power dynamics and systemic disadvantages faced by Indigenous populations. Therefore, the uncritical application of AI, particularly in social policy and service delivery, can lead to discriminatory outcomes and further marginalize these communities . The report highlights specific concerns regarding the use of predictive risk modeling (PRM) in areas such as child protection. In both Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, Indigenous children are significantly overrepresented in state care systems. Walter and Kukutai point out that algorithms used in these systems often rely on historical data that reflects past discriminatory practices and socioeconomic disparities rather than accurately assessing current risk or need . For instance, an algorithm might identify risk factors correlated with poverty, which disproportionately affects Indigenous communities due to historical and ongoing colonization. This can lead to a higher likelihood of Indigenous families being flagged by the system, not necessarily because of an increased actual risk of maltreatment, but because the algorithm is trained on data that encodes these systemic inequalities. The report emphasizes that algorithms ""do not understand social, historical contexts"" , and thus, without careful consideration of IDS, AI can become a tool for ""reworking the old adage around data: if the algorithm data ‘rules’ target problems where Indigenous peoples are over-represented; then the problematic Indigene will be the target"" . This ""problematic Indigene"" framing is a direct consequence of data that reflects colonial oversight and control, rather than Indigenous realities or aspirations.</p><p id="""">### 4.3 Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) Principles (e.g., InDatOCS)<br>Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) is a critical framework for ensuring that data related to Indigenous peoples is collected, managed, accessed, and used in ways that align with their values, priorities, and right to self-determination. While the ACOLA report by Walter and Kukutai provides a foundational understanding of IDS in the context of AI , other Australian initiatives have developed specific models and principles to guide its implementation. One such model is the **""InDatOCS"" framework**, which stands for Indigenous Data Ownership, Custodianship, and Stewardship. This model, proposed within the Australian context, offers a structured approach to recognizing and operationalizing Indigenous rights and interests in data . The InDatOCS model emphasizes that Indigenous data is not merely a resource to be extracted but an asset in which Indigenous peoples have inherent and ongoing interests. It seeks to address the historical and ongoing colonial practices of data collection and use that have often excluded Indigenous voices and perspectives, leading to misrepresentation and harm. The InDatOCS framework, as detailed in the paper ""Indigenous Data Governance in Australia: Towards A National Indigenous Data Sovereignty Framework,"" argues that existing legal frameworks in Australia have not adequately extended the concept of ""stolen assets"" or ""stolen wages"" to include data, despite data being a significant asset class for Indigenous peoples . The paper highlights that a vast amount of Indigenous personal data is held by government agencies, often without coherent regulation or Indigenous control, stemming from Australia's unique colonial administrative history. The InDatOCS model proposes a governance structure that explicitly recognizes Indigenous ownership of their data, the role of Indigenous custodians in safeguarding it according to cultural protocols, and the responsibility of stewards (who may be Indigenous or non-Indigenous entities) to manage the data in ways that are accountable to Indigenous peoples and beneficial to their communities . This model draws inspiration from international frameworks like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), adapting its principles of data subject rights to the collective and culturally specific context of Indigenous Australians. For instance, it suggests that Indigenous peoples could be recognized as ""special data subjects"" within such a framework, acknowledging their unique historical and ongoing relationship with data and the state .</p><p id="""">The principles underpinning InDatOCS and other IDS frameworks, such as those articulated by the Maiam nayri Wingara Indigenous Data Sovereignty Collective and the Australian Indigenous Governance Institute, assert that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have the right to exercise control over the entire data ecosystem concerning them . This includes the creation, development, stewardship, analysis, dissemination, and infrastructure of data. Key principles often include:<br>1. &nbsp;**Ownership**: Indigenous communities collectively own their data, similar to how an individual owns their personal information.<br>2. &nbsp;**Control**: Indigenous communities have the right to control all aspects of research and information management processes that impact them, including data collection, use, and dissemination.<br>3. &nbsp;**Access**: Indigenous communities must have access to data about themselves and their communities, regardless of where it is held, and the right to manage and make decisions regarding access to their collective information.<br>4. &nbsp;**Possession/Stewardship**: This refers to the physical control and management of data, ensuring it is held and managed in a way that respects Indigenous rights and protocols.<br>5. &nbsp;**Collective Benefit**: Data ecosystems should be designed to enable Indigenous peoples to derive benefit from their data.<br>6. &nbsp;**Responsibility**: Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to ensure its use supports Indigenous self-determination and collective benefit, and to share how the data is used.<br>7. &nbsp;**Ethics**: Indigenous peoples' rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data lifecycle.<br>These principles are often complemented by the **CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics)** developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA), which aim to ensure that data governance respects Indigenous values and priorities , . The implementation of IDS principles like those in the InDatOCS model has significant implications for AI development and deployment. It means that AI systems intended for use with or impacting Indigenous communities must be co-designed or at least co-governed with those communities from the outset. This includes defining the problem, identifying relevant data sources, determining appropriate data collection methods, establishing ethical review processes, and deciding how AI outputs will be used and by whom. For example, the ""Five Safes"" framework, often used by Australian government agencies for data access, can be adapted to an IDS context by re-framing its questions (Safe Projects, Safe People, Safe Data, Safe Settings, Safe Outputs) to prioritize Indigenous interests and control . This ensures that data is used appropriately, by trusted individuals, in a secure manner, and that outputs do not lead to disclosure or harm. The goal is to move beyond a compliance-based approach to one that is fundamentally relational and grounded in Indigenous self-determination, ensuring that AI serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a new vector of colonization. The National Agreement on Closing the Gap, particularly Priority Reforms Three (Transforming Government Organisations) and Four (Shared Access to Data and Information at a Regional Level), also provides a policy impetus for advancing IDS in Australia .</p><p id="""">### 4.4 Global Indigenous AI Initiatives (e.g., Abundant Intelligences)<br>The ""Abundant Intelligences"" research program stands as a significant global Indigenous-led initiative aimed at fundamentally re-conceptualizing and re-designing artificial intelligence (AI) based on Indigenous Knowledge (IK) systems . This international, interdisciplinary program, led by an Indigenous-majority team, argues that the current trajectory of AI development is plagued by fundamental epistemological shortcomings. These shortcomings arise from the dominance of certain Western rationalist epistemologies that exclude diverse ways of knowing, leading to the systematic operationalization of bias against non-white, non-male, and non-Western peoples . The core proposition of Abundant Intelligences is to engage deeply with AI to explore how different conceptions of intelligence, grounded in IK systems, can be embodied in these technologies. The program draws on the rich plurality of Indigenous knowledge systems, bringing together diverse thought, culture, and protocols to rebuild AI's epistemological foundations. The aim is to transform AI from its current role, which often reinforces colonial practices of exclusion, extraction, manipulation, and eradication, into ""engines of abundance"" that enable better care for communities and the world . This initiative directly challenges the ""cognitive imperialism"" prevalent in mainstream AI development, where Western perspectives dominate, often sidelining or misrepresenting Indigenous realities .</p><p id="""">The Abundant Intelligences program is not merely a critique but offers a proactive research agenda. It seeks to develop culturally grounded AI systems that support Indigenous ways of knowing and being, thereby fostering Indigenous futures where communities thrive and their knowledges are not further damaged by harmful technologies , . The program's methodology is rooted in Indigenous epistemologies, which provide robust conceptual frameworks for understanding how technology can be developed in ways that integrate it into existing lifeways, support the flourishing of future generations, and are optimized for abundance rather than scarcity . This approach contrasts sharply with the often extractive and individualistic paradigms underpinning much of contemporary AI. By centering Indigenous leadership and knowledge, Abundant Intelligences aims to create AI that is not only more equitable and culturally sensitive but also more attuned to the complex, relational nature of the world. The initiative highlights that Indigenous peoples have a long history of adapting their knowledge systems to new scientific and technological advances, and integrating AI is seen as the latest example of this ongoing innovation . This perspective reframes Indigenous communities not as passive recipients or victims of technology but as active agents and innovators in the AI space. The ""Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Position Paper,"" a monograph emerging from the Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Working Group and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, is another key document that outlines considerations for ethically engaging with AI from an Indigenous perspective, emphasizing relationality and responsibility . These resources collectively provide a roadmap for moving towards an AI ecosystem that is more just, inclusive, and reflective of the world's diverse knowledge systems. They challenge the dominant narrative of AI as an inevitable force and instead present it as a domain where deliberate, ethical choices can and must be made to ensure it serves humanity equitably.</p><p id="""">The ""Abundant Intelligences"" research program, as detailed on its official website , represents a significant global effort to reimagine and redesign Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on Indigenous Knowledge (IK) systems. The project's core mission is to advance methods for improving AI to better serve Indigenous communities by exploring and developing culturally-grounded AI systems. These systems aim to support Indigenous ways of knowing and recognize the ""abundant multiplicity of ways of being intelligent in the world"" . This initiative, while not specifically Australian, offers a powerful model and philosophical underpinning for efforts within Australia, such as the proposed Empathy Ledger. The project's emphasis on Indigenous epistemologies that are ""optimized for abundance rather than scarcity"" directly challenges the often extractive and transactional nature of conventional data practices and AI development . By focusing on how technology can be integrated into existing lifeways and support the flourishing of future generations, ""Abundant Intelligences"" provides a visionary framework that aligns with the goals of community-owned solutions and narrative sovereignty. The research questions driving ""Abundant Intelligences"" are particularly pertinent: ""How can we integrate and adapt existing advanced computational methods into Indigenous Knowledge systems?"" and ""How can we develop new computational practices within Indigenous contexts to support the flourishing of Indigenous communities?"" . These questions resonate deeply with the challenges and opportunities faced in the Australian context, where there is a growing movement to ensure that AI serves Indigenous communities rather than undermining their sovereignty or perpetuating harm. The project's international collaboration, involving researchers and Indigenous communities from Canada, the United States, and New Zealand, highlights the global nature of the struggle for Indigenous self-determination in the digital age . While the project's website &nbsp;does not explicitly list Australian partners in its core team, its foundational principles and the resources it generates (such as Indigenous-centered AI design guidelines and novel hybrid methodologies) are invaluable for inspiring and informing Australian initiatives. The ""Abundant Intelligences"" project, with its significant funding and interdisciplinary approach, demonstrates a serious commitment to shifting the paradigm of AI development towards one that is more inclusive, ethical, and respectful of diverse knowledge systems . This global perspective can bolster advocacy efforts in Australia by showing that the push for Indigenous-led AI is part of a broader, well-supported international movement.</p><p id="""">## 5. Pathways to Change: Action and Reflection<br>### 5.1 The Examined Institution (Socrates)<br>Socrates’ provocation—*the unexamined life is not worth living*—lands squarely on our systems. The unexamined grant programme risks doing harm while claiming virtue. Examination does not mean paralysis. It means asking, repeatedly:<br>* Do our processes **enlarge or diminish** community agency?<br>* Are we measuring what matters to communities, or only what is convenient for us?<br>* Who is allowed to define “evidence” and “impact”, and who is excluded?<br>In practice, an examined institution balances **action with reflection**. It changes course when communities say, “This isn’t working.” It funds learning, not just outputs. It honours local languages, protocols and timelines. This commitment to ongoing self-assessment and adaptation is crucial for ensuring that philanthropic practices, especially in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, remain aligned with ethical principles and genuinely serve the communities they aim to support. It requires creating mechanisms for feedback, accountability, and shared learning, where communities are active participants in evaluating impact and shaping future directions. The examined institution is not afraid to confront uncomfortable truths about its own power dynamics and the unintended consequences of its actions, and it is willing to fundamentally rethink its approaches based on what it learns.</p><p id="""">### 5.2 From Transactions to Relationships: A New Funding Model<br>A relationship-centred funding model looks different from traditional, transactional approaches. It prioritizes trust, mutual respect, and long-term partnership over short-term outputs and rigid compliance. Key characteristics include:<br>* &nbsp; **Trust-based philanthropy:** This involves fewer burdensome application forms, multi-year unrestricted funding, and reporting mechanisms that emphasize conversations and storytelling rather than solely quantitative metrics. It recognizes that communities are best placed to understand their own needs and how to address them.<br>* &nbsp; **Participatory grantmaking:** This model actively involves community members in the decision-making processes, from setting funding priorities and criteria to co-deciding on grant allocations. It shifts power from external ""experts"" to those with lived experience.<br>* &nbsp; **Co-design:** Programmes and initiatives are developed collaboratively with the communities they are intended to serve, from the initial conceptualization through to implementation and evaluation. This ensures relevance, cultural appropriateness, and community ownership.<br>* &nbsp; **Evaluation that listens:** Impact is assessed not only through quantitative data but also through qualitative narratives that capture deeper changes, such as healing, strengthened cultural identity, community connection, and increased self-determination.<br>* &nbsp; **Capacity for community tech:** Instead of AI being a tool primarily for large organizations to optimize their processes, it is supported and developed to serve as an assistant to communities, helping them achieve their own goals and manage their own data and narratives.<br>This shift requires funders to move from being distant benefactors to engaged partners, willing to learn from and be transformed by the communities they support.</p><p id="""">### 5.3 A 6-12 Month Action Plan for Philanthropy<br>To translate these principles into tangible change, philanthropic organizations can adopt a focused action plan over the next 6-12 months.

Envisioning Success: A Future Shaped by Community Agency<br>### 6.1 What Success Looks Like<br>Success in this reimagined philanthropic landscape is not merely about the number of grants distributed or the volume of data processed. Instead, it is measured by the extent to which communities are empowered and their agency is amplified. Key indicators of success include:<br>* &nbsp; **Funding flows stabilise locally**, with an increase in multi-year, unrestricted support for community-led organizations, allowing them to plan for the long term and respond flexibly to emerging needs.<br>* &nbsp; **Storytellers retain sovereignty** over their narratives and share equitably in the value their stories create, whether through attribution, compensation, or influence over how their knowledge is used.<br>* &nbsp; **Grant decisions improve in quality and fairness** because assessors have access to richer, more contextual information directly from communities, and are held accountable to those communities, not just to bureaucratic procedures.<br>* &nbsp; **Technology, including AI, serves to deepen relationships and enhance community capacity**, rather than acting as a barrier or a tool for further extraction. AI becomes the community's assistant, not just the funder's.<br>* &nbsp; **Media narratives begin to shift** from predominantly deficit-based portrayals of communities to stories that highlight evidence of community-owned impact, innovation, and resilience.<br>Ultimately, success looks like a philanthropic sector that is a genuine partner in self-determination, where power is shared, and where the wisdom and leadership of communities are at the forefront of creating positive change.</p><p id="""">### 6.2 Conclusion: Choosing Agency Over Inevitability<br>AI can either harden extractive habits or **free us to re-centre relationship and responsibility**. The difference is a choice, not a fate. Empathy Ledger offers concrete architecture for that choice—anchoring consent, provenance and fair value in the hands of storytellers. If philanthropy and government practise the examined life—asking who holds power, who defines evidence, who owns the story—then we can flip the system: **from paperwork to people, from extraction to reciprocity, from inevitability to agency**. That is how community-owned solutions move from the margins to the mainstream—and stay there. This requires a conscious and continuous effort to challenge existing power structures, to listen deeply to communities, and to be willing to adapt and learn. By choosing agency over the myth of inevitability, we can collectively shape an AI-driven future that is more just, equitable, and reflective of the diverse wisdom and aspirations of all people. The time to make this choice is now, as the foundations of our future are being laid.</p><p id="""">## 7. Further Reading and Resources (Primarily Australian Focus)<br>### 7.1 Key Academic Papers and Reports<br>To deepen understanding of the complex interplay between AI, Indigenous communities, and data sovereignty, several key academic papers and reports offer critical insights. The Australian Council of Learned Academies (ACOLA) published a significant input paper titled ""Artificial Intelligence and Indigenous Data Sovereignty,"" authored by Professor Maggie Walter and Professor Tahu Kukutai . This paper delves into how AI, while offering potential benefits, often lacks transparency in its impact on Indigenous peoples and can perpetuate biases and inequalities if not carefully governed . It underscores the importance of the Indigenous Data Sovereignty (ID-SOV) movement, which asserts Indigenous rights to own, control, access, and possess data about their communities, peoples, lands, and resources, drawing on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) . The paper also highlights specific national initiatives, such as the Maiam nayri Wingara Indigenous Data Sovereignty Collective in Australia and Te Mana Raraunga Māori Data Sovereignty Network in Aotearoa New Zealand, which are actively working to establish principles for Indigenous data governance . Another important resource is the work of Dr. Tamika Worrell, whose research, such as ""Digital Distortion: How AI Amplified Misinformation in Australia's Voice Referendum,"" published in the Journal of Global Indigeneity, examines the tangible harms AI can cause, including the spread of misinformation that disproportionately affects Indigenous communities . This work emphasizes the urgent need for regulations and the prioritization of Indigenous data sovereignty to prevent further harm . Furthermore, the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) has developed a ""Framework for the Governance of Indigenous Data,"" which provides guidelines for the Australian Public Service to ensure that government-held data better reflects the priorities and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples . This framework outlines principles such as partnering with Indigenous peoples, building data-related capabilities, providing knowledge of data assets, and fostering an inclusive data system . These documents collectively provide a robust theoretical and policy foundation for advocating for ethical AI and Indigenous data sovereignty.</p><p id="""">The ""Out of the Black Box: Indigenous protocols for AI"" report, stemming from the IP/AI incubator, outlines a ""Country Centered Design"" methodology and explores how Indigenous knowledge can guide AI design and engineering . This work emphasizes that Indigenous AI needs to be localized, integrating with local laws and cultural protocols, and considers future cultural interactions with AI through experimentation and prototyping . It posits that Indigenous knowledge can bridge ontological and epistemological gaps between machines, humans, and the environment. The report highlights that Indigenous knowledge and processes are inseparable from complex systems and cannot function in isolation within synthetic systems lacking the complexity of natural and Indigenous systems. A key finding is the critical need for Indigenous leadership in AI, adhering to the principle of ""nothing about us without us"" . The report suggests that implementing Indigenous protocols in AI is an ongoing process of engagement, challenge, innovation, and response, embedded in the obligation to care for Country and reflected in every layer of the digital stack. This perspective challenges the pursuit of a singular, comprehensive Indigenous AI protocol, advocating instead for a dynamic, culturally specific, and relational approach . The ACOLA (Australian Council of Learned Academies) input paper on ""Artificial Intelligence and Indigenous Data Sovereignty"" by Maggie Walter and Tahu Kukutai, discusses the data dependency of AI and machine learning, noting that data possesses cultural, strategic, and economic value, which increases with technological advancements , . The paper underscores the growing global concern among Indigenous peoples regarding data ownership, usage, access, and decision-making rights . It frames the Indigenous Data Sovereignty (ID-SOV) movement as an assertion of Indigenous rights to own, control, access, and possess data derived from them, rooted in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and aimed at ensuring data use supports collective wellbeing . The paper highlights the Maiam nayri Wingara Indigenous Data Sovereignty Collective in Australia, which issued a 2018 communique demanding Indigenous decision-making and control over data ecosystems. It also references Te Mana Raraunga, the Māori Data Sovereignty Network in New Zealand, which advocates for Māori rights and interests in data, emphasizing the use of ""tikanga"" (ethics, processes, principles) to govern data for collective benefit . The paper concludes that realizing the potential benefits of AI for Indigenous peoples is intrinsically linked to Indigenous leadership and governance in determining how, when, and in what context these technologies are applied .</p><p id="""">The ""Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Position Paper"" by Jason Lewis and others, associated with the Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Working Group (IP/AI WG), offers global guidelines for Indigenous-centred AI design , . These guidelines emphasize principles such as locality, relationality, reciprocity, responsibility, relevance, and accountability. They call for developing governance guidelines from Indigenous protocols, recognizing the cultural nature of all computational technology, applying ethical design to the extended stack (beyond just the algorithm), and respecting and supporting data sovereignty . This position paper is a foundational document in the discourse on decolonizing AI, advocating for a shift from merely including Indigenous perspectives to transforming AI through Indigenous knowledges and worldviews. The IP/AI WG's work, including incubators and prototypes, brings together Indigenous creatives, researchers, and technologists to explore how Indigenous protocols can inform the development of AI, ensuring that these technologies are aligned with principles of Caring for Country and Caring for Kin , . The initiative stresses that for AI to serve all humanity, it must recognize and respect the multiplicity of worldviews, confronting the colonial foundations of digital knowledge systems . The ""Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance,"" issued at the 2024 World AI Conference, acknowledges the profound impact of AI and the need to promote its development while ensuring safety, reliability, controllability, and fairness . It calls for global cooperation to realize AI's potential for the greater well-being of humanity, emphasizing the importance of leveraging AI in fields like healthcare, education, and ecology. The declaration advocates for an open and shared benefit spirit, promoting exchanges and cooperation on global AI research resources, and establishing platforms for technology transfer and commercialization. It also stresses the need to safeguard high-quality data development with high-level data security, promote the free and orderly flow of data in accordance with the law, and oppose discriminatory and exclusive data training . While not Indigenous-specific, its principles of fairness, safety, and global cooperation provide a broader context for discussions on ethical AI development. The declaration's focus on empowering various sectors and ensuring that AI development is inclusive and respects human values aligns with some of the core tenets of Indigenous data sovereignty and ethical AI frameworks.</p><p id="""">### 7.2 Indigenous-Led AI Projects and Initiatives<br>Several Indigenous-led AI projects and initiatives in Australia serve as practical examples of how technology can be harnessed in ways that support self-determination and community priorities. The **Healthy Country AI** program, led by NAILSMA (North Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Alliance) in collaboration with CSIRO and other partners like Microsoft and the Telstra Foundation, is a prime example , . This initiative empowers Indigenous rangers and Traditional Owners across northern Australia to use AI and digital tools for monitoring and managing their lands and seas, focusing on co-design and digital inclusion to deliver environmental, cultural, and economic benefits . Specific projects under this program include tackling wetland weeds in Kakadu National Park with Bininj Traditional Owners, protecting turtle nests with Wik Traditional Owners on Cape York Peninsula, and managing feral animal impacts with Normanby Land Management , . Another notable example is the work of Dr. Mikaela Jade, an Indigenous tech entrepreneur who utilizes augmented and mixed reality technologies to share Indigenous stories and cultural knowledge . In Aotearoa New Zealand, Te Hiku Media, a tribal broadcasting network, has been developing speech recognition and natural language processing tools to support Māori language revitalization, demonstrating the potential of AI in cultural preservation . These projects underscore the critical importance of Indigenous leadership in the conception, design, and implementation of AI technologies to ensure they align with community values, needs, and aspirations, thereby countering the risks of technological colonialism and data misappropriation. The success of these initiatives often lies in their deep collaboration with communities and their commitment to ethical data practices and governance by Traditional Owners .</p><p id="""">The Indigenous Protocols and Artificial Intelligence (IP/AI) Working Group and its subsequent incubator, supported by ANAT (Australian Network for Art and Technology), focus on how Indigenous protocols can inform the development and governance of AI , . This initiative brings together Indigenous creatives, researchers, and technologists, such as Tyson Yunkaporta, Megan Kelleher, and Rick Shaw, to conceptualize and design AI futures grounded in Indigenous social and environmental principles, embodied by concepts like ""Caring for Country, Caring for Kin"" . The IP/AI incubator aimed to explore the possibilities of Australian Indigenous AI through experimentation and prototyping, emphasizing a regionalized approach that honors local cultural knowledge, systems, protocols, perspectives, environmental needs, and social conditions . The work challenges the often Western-centric development of AI, advocating for Indigenous leadership and the integration of Indigenous epistemologies into the very architecture of AI systems. The initiative seeks to move beyond a simple binary of technical work versus ethical considerations, proposing that ethics and meaning are inseparable from the system itself when viewed through an Indigenous lens . Te Hiku Media, a Māori tribal broadcasting station in Aotearoa New Zealand, is an inspiring global example of Indigenous-led AI development, particularly in the realm of language revitalization . They have been actively developing speech recognition and natural language processing tools capable of understanding and processing the Māori language, Te Reo Māori. This work is a powerful demonstration of Indigenous data sovereignty in action, where Māori control the data, the technology development process, and the application of AI to serve their cultural aspirations. The development of these AI tools is crucial for preserving and promoting Te Reo Māori, an endangered language, by creating new avenues for its use in digital spaces and media. Te Hiku Media's efforts highlight how AI can be harnessed to empower Indigenous cultures and languages, rather than marginalizing them, when Indigenous communities are at the forefront of its development and deployment. Their work serves as an important model for other Indigenous communities globally looking to leverage AI for cultural preservation and strengthening.</p><p id="""">Mikaela Jade, an Indigenous Australian tech entrepreneur, is another example of Indigenous innovation in the tech space, utilizing augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies to tell stories in Indigenous communities . While not exclusively AI-focused in the same way as large language models, AR/MR often incorporate AI elements for object recognition, spatial mapping, and interactive storytelling. Jade's work through her company, Indigital, focuses on cultural preservation and education, allowing users to engage with Indigenous knowledge and stories in immersive ways. This initiative demonstrates how emerging technologies can be used to elevate and share Indigenous cultures on Indigenous terms. By creating platforms and experiences that are co-designed with communities, Indigital empowers Indigenous people to be the storytellers and custodians of their digital cultural heritage. This aligns with the principles of Indigenous data sovereignty and the broader movement towards Indigenous-led technological development that respects cultural protocols and generates benefits for communities. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) article, ""Indigenous-led tech solutions for a better planet,"" offers a global perspective but includes a pertinent Australian example: the Cape York turtle project . This project, as previously discussed, involves Indigenous landowners and scientists combining AI with traditional knowledge to protect endangered turtle nests through real-time information and location tracking, enabling rangers to intervene against predators . This initiative is a clear demonstration of how AI can be a supportive tool in Indigenous-led conservation efforts, blending modern technology with ancient wisdom for tangible environmental benefits. The article itself advocates for the inclusion, participation, and approval of Indigenous peoples in the creation of technological systems that are intended to benefit everyone, highlighting a crucial principle for ethical AI development and deployment. While the ITU piece provides a snapshot, further investigation into specific Australian organizations and research institutions working at this intersection would yield more comprehensive information. For instance, exploring the work of Indigenous ranger groups involved in similar AI-assisted conservation projects, or university research departments specializing in Indigenous knowledge and AI, could uncover a wealth of case studies and practical examples. The emphasis in such projects is often on community control, data sovereignty, and ensuring that AI applications are culturally appropriate and serve the specific goals defined by the Indigenous communities themselves. These initiatives are critical in demonstrating viable pathways for AI to contribute positively to Indigenous self-determination and environmental stewardship.</p><p id="""">### 7.3 Frameworks and Tools for Indigenous Data Sovereignty<br>The movement for Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) has produced several key frameworks and tools designed to empower Indigenous peoples in Australia and globally to assert control over their data. The **Maiam nayri Wingara Indigenous Data Sovereignty Collective** in Australia is a leading voice, having released a 2018 national conference communique demanding Indigenous decision-making and control over data ecosystems concerning their communities , . This collective, alongside the Australian Indigenous Governance Institute, advocates for the rights of Indigenous nations over data about them, regardless of where it is held, and the right to data required for nation rebuilding . Similarly, in Aotearoa New Zealand, **Te Mana Raraunga Māori Data Sovereignty Network** champions Māori rights and interests in data, emphasizing the importance of data quality and integrity, and exploring how tikanga (Māori customary practices and principles) can inform data governance . At a governmental level, the **National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA)** has published the ""Framework for the Governance of Indigenous Data"" . This framework provides specific guidelines for Australian Public Service (APS) agencies to enhance Indigenous agency over data held by the Commonwealth. Its core principles include: 1. Partnering with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout the data lifecycle; 2. Building data-related capabilities within both APS staff and Indigenous partners; 3. Providing clear knowledge of data assets to Indigenous communities; and 4. Fostering an inclusive data system within the APS . Internationally, the **CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance** (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) offer a complementary framework to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), emphasizing Indigenous rights and well-being in data management. These frameworks and tools are crucial for ensuring that data related to Indigenous peoples is used in ways that support their collective well-being, self-determination, and cultural integrity, rather than perpetuating harm or exploitation.</p><p id="""">The Maiam nayri Wingara Indigenous Data Sovereignty Principles, developed by the Maiam nayri Wingara Indigenous Data Sovereignty Collective in Australia, provide a foundational framework for ethical data practice from an Indigenous perspective , . These principles assert the rights of Indigenous peoples to control data related to their peoples, territories, lifeways, and natural resources. They emphasize collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, ethics (including Indigenous ethics and values), and future use. The principles call for data to be used in ways that support Indigenous aspirations for wellbeing and self-determination, and for Indigenous governance over data collection, management, access, and dissemination. This framework is crucial for guiding organizations and researchers in their engagement with Indigenous data, ensuring that processes are respectful, equitable, and empower Indigenous communities. The work of Professor Sandra Eades and Professor Marcia Langton with the Indigenous Data Network at the University of Melbourne further supports these efforts by focusing on Indigenous data sovereignty and defining Indigenous data priorities . Te Mana Raraunga, the Māori Data Sovereignty Network in Aotearoa New Zealand, has developed a charter that articulates Māori rights and interests in data, emphasizing the quality and integrity of Māori data . This framework is grounded in ""tikanga Māori"" (Māori customs and protocols), which provides the ethical and cultural foundation for how data related to Māori people, language, culture, resources, and environments should be collected, managed, used, and shared. Te Mana Raraunga advocates for Māori to exercise ""rangatiratanga"" (authority, sovereignty) over their data, ensuring that data governance models reflect Māori worldviews and priorities. This includes the right to access and use Māori data to support Māori development and self-determination. The network is actively involved in exploring how tikanga can be applied to rethink scientific approaches to data governance, use, and validation, ensuring that data practices benefit Māori communities and uphold Māori values . This work provides a strong model for culturally grounded data sovereignty frameworks.</p><p id="""">Dr. Terri Janke, a Wuthathi, Yadhaigana, and Meriam woman and a leading expert on Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP), has developed the ""True Tracks®"" framework . While not exclusively an AI framework, True Tracks® offers ten principles for best-practice Indigenous engagement that are highly relevant to the development and deployment of AI systems that interact with Indigenous knowledge or data. These principles are: respect, self-determination, consent &amp; consultation, interpretation, cultural integrity, secrecy &amp; privacy, attribution, benefit sharing, maintaining Indigenous culture, and recognition &amp; protection . Applying these principles to AI means ensuring that Indigenous communities are involved from the outset in decisions about how their data and knowledge are used, that cultural protocols are respected, that benefits are shared equitably, and that Indigenous cultures are maintained and strengthened, not diminished or exploited. Dr. Janke emphasizes the need for Indigenous data sovereignty—control over how Indigenous data is created, stored, shared, and used—as a critical component of protecting ICIP in the age of AI . The CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) Principles for Indigenous Data Governance offer a global framework developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA). While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets for Australia, they are a widely recognized international standard that complements and aligns with Australian Indigenous Data Sovereignty movements like Maiam nayri Wingara. The CARE principles emphasize that data should be used for the collective benefit of Indigenous peoples, that Indigenous peoples have the authority to control their data, that those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to build respectful relationships and ensure data quality, and that data governance should be based on Indigenous ethical frameworks and rights . These principles are designed to be used alongside the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles, ensuring that data advancements do not come at the expense of Indigenous rights and interests. The CARE principles provide a valuable tool for assessing and improving data governance practices to ensure they are equitable and respectful of Indigenous sovereignty.</p><p>‍</p>",,,,,,,,

Their work includes surveying and managing cultural heritage sites, sharing traditional knowledge through on-country activities, monitoring seagrass, coral reefs, and fish species in partnership with researchers, participating in fire management for habitat protection, and managing feral animals and weeds across the islands. Engaging with Elders and key partners, the rangers facilitate progress on caring for country priorities. Nic and I have known Richard for years—myself through Corrective Services and Nic through Orange Sky. Together, we talked about the importance of drone mapping for regeneration projects, using controlled burns and water management.

The young rangers, some participating in the process for the first time, carried out their roles under the watchful eyes of Uncle Alan and Richard. It was incredible to witness and be part of the process of protocol, knowing that each step we took together strengthened our ties and built stronger relationships.

Each night, Nic and I alternated between a traditional bed and our own creation at Club Kuta, assessing sleep quality and noting adjustments to improve comfort. We focused on refining our designs, adjusting mattress firmness, and ensuring ease of assembly. Every evening was an opportunity to reflect on the day's progress, tweaking our prototypes to better suit the needs of the community. These small changes were crucial to developing something that was not only practical but also comfortable and durable.</p><p id="""">One&nbsp;Day 3, I had the chance to experience ranger Whatta’s mangrove education session with the schoolchildren. It showed how deeply environmental knowledge resonates when it’s shared in context and culture. The young rangers, who had themselves learned from Elders, were now passing that knowledge on to the children—teaching them about the significance of mangroves, the delicate balance of their ecosystems, and the role they play in coastal health. It was inspiring to witness this cycle of knowledge, with the young rangers stepping confidently into teaching roles while the children absorbed every word, their curiosity piqued by hands-on learning. The sense of continuity, of knowledge being passed through generations, reinforced the importance of our work and the relationships we were nurturing.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672d29c58cd63e53617fed60_672d270fda11c7af44f34756_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-166.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Park Ranger Whatta with the class talking mangroves</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p id="""">A conversation with Eva Haines, Deputy Chief Executive Officer at Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council, extended earlier discussions we'd had about the Christmas Cup football carnival. Just a few days earlier, others had suggested we propose the bed initiative to the council. This conversation opened up the idea of using the beds at the upcoming Christmas Cup football carnival—a real-world test and a chance for young people to earn money through bed assembly. Practical opportunities like these can often plant the seeds of sustainable change.</p><p id="""">As my plane lifted off on day four, the markers of progress were clear: ten beds crafted and distributed, each providing valuable feedback; a partnership with the Rangers that stretches beyond furniture to include drone mapping for cultural site documentation; and an ambitious plan with the PCYC to engage young people in social enterprise. The Christmas Cup looms as our next milestone—100 beds to be assembled in early December, a testament to the community’s trust and vision. Ongoing connections with Elders like Alan Palm Island remind us that true progress moves at the speed of ceremony, not commerce.</p><p id="""">We know we’ll make mistakes, that our feet will stumble on paths we’re still learning to walk. But in each bed built, each conversation shared, each ceremony attended, we’re learning to be better allies, better listeners, better partners in a journey that’s been too long one-sided. In the end, it’s not about the beds—it’s about creating space for local knowledge to flourish, for cultural intelligence to lead, for communities to write their own stories of regeneration and growth.</p><p id="""">This truth echoes across our work in Kalgoorlie, the Lower Gulf, Alice Springs and Tennet Creek. It’s present in every prototype we test, every community meeting we attend, every protocol we follow. As the mainland approached, I thought of all we’d left behind—beds that would cradle dreams, conversations that would spark change, connections that would grow like mangrove roots, strong and vital. In my notebook, I wrote not of metrics or timelines, but of privilege and responsibility, of the honour of being invited into stories far older than our own, and of the hope that, in our small way, we’re helping write new chapters that honour the old.</p><p id="""">Because true revolution isn’t delivered on a barge or measured in bed frames. It grows in the spaces between ceremony and practical action, between ancient wisdom and modern needs, between listening and doing. It’s found in the moment a young ranger shares knowledge with children, in the pride of a community member assembling furniture, in the simple act of following protocol before any work begins.</p><p id="""">This is the path forward—one that bridges the practical with the profound, that measures success not just in units delivered but in relationships strengthened. Each flat-pack bed is an opportunity for connection, each assembly a chance for empowerment, each visit a step in a journey of mutual respect and understanding.</p><p id="""">One bed, one connection, one story at a time.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">BK</em></p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672d29c58cd63e53617fed71_672d2724ac6772df2c59de7d_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-104.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">A Butler Bay sunrise on Day 3</em></strong></figcaption></figure>","This story captures a transformative journey to Palm Island, where the process of building beds becomes a powerful metaphor for community connection, cultural respect, and regeneration.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672d247273aa9dd144eb951a_Palm%20Island%20-%20Goods%20Low%20res-9.jpg,Benjamin Knight,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/65ce868b02decb22a6368b6b_BK_Photo.jpg,Connection and Community,20 mins,,

This journey to Quandamooka Country has become a pilgrimage of sorts—each visit deepening my understanding of a place where knowledge, strength, and discovery flow like the tides around the island.</p><p id="""">Today feels different. I'm joined by companions whose presence creates a small constellation of purpose: Chris Baker, the Food Connect Shed Coordinator, seeking partnerships and oyster wisdom; and Leia Alex, ready to explore storytelling opportunities with local partners. Two fellow travelers open to experiencing all this Country has to offer.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67c01e7da9dc69023633c9a0_Shaun%20Wapit%20Photo%20Feb%2025.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">The Caretaker</h2><p id="""">Shaun Fisher welcomes us with the easy warmth of someone deeply connected to this place. His brief departure to take his twins to school—a reminder that he moves between roles as visionary, entrepreneur, and father to six children with practiced grace. While he's gone, we walk through the cemetery, and I feel the accumulating weight of connection to this place, nurtured through conversations with Elders, community members, and young people who have generously shared their time and wisdom.</p><p id="""">Upon his return, Shaun takes us to a clearing near his oyster lease—sacred ground for his dreams. In this space, he envisions community gathering places, boat sheds, training facilities, and healing spaces. It's not just infrastructure he describes, but a living ecosystem where economic prosperity intertwines with wellbeing and connection to Country.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67c01e6e10f06223f35ffd23_Shaun%20Wapit%20Feb%2025.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">History's Shadows</h2><p id="""">The drive to the protest camp offers a window into deeper complexities. Shaun speaks of Elders directing the creation of skeleton effigies—powerful symbols of ancestors standing in protection of sacred sites threatened by a proposed whale research centre. His words paint the layered reality of Quandamooka Country: centuries of disruption through disease that decimated 70% of the population, sand mining that claimed over half the island and destroyed dozens of sacred sites, and the ongoing pressure of privileged encroachment.</p><p id="""">Our conversation in the car navigates the intricate channels of colonisation's impacts, ecosystem destruction, and the complex relationships between community members with different visions for their Country's future.</p><h2 id="""">Waters of Continuity</h2><p id="""">Before heading to our meeting at with other partners, we pause at a natural stream—a place Shaun has visited for decades and now shares with his children. This water represents continuity and sustenance, a gathering place where generations have cooled themselves and harvested food from clean waters that still flow despite everything.</p><h2 id="""">Convergence on Salt Water</h2><p id="""">The day takes an unexpected turn when we learn that Sally and Wapit from Country Connect are at the other ferry terminal. Shaun's boat skims across the water to collect them, creating a powerful convergence: Shaun, the local visionary; Chris, the social enterprise facilitator; Leia, the connection-maker; Sally and Wapit, knowledge carriers from another Country; and myself—still finding my place in this circle, perhaps as witness and reflector of the longer story unfolding through daily efforts.</p><p id="""">At the oyster farm, Shaun works with patient explanation, sharing both technique and vision. The farm represents more than livelihood—it's a platform for cultural continuity, family support, and community prosperity. When Wapit speaks of taking these learnings back to his own community, I witness the ancient practice of knowledge exchange being renewed between First Nations peoples.</p><p id="""">As we taste oysters together, the moment transcends a simple gathering. It becomes a ceremony of sharing wisdom, building connection, and continuing a story tens of thousands of years in the making.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67c01ea389bff910eb8a56c4_Shaun%20Wapit%20Feb%2025%20(1).jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67c01eb63278e50f25a3e801_Shaun%20Wapit%20Feb%2025%20(3).jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">Walking Together</h2><p id="""">When it's time to leave, Shaun supports Wapit as they walk back to the boat. I capture this image—two knowledge holders walking together—and it resonates deeply within me. In this simple gesture of care and respect, I glimpse the essence of what this work is about.</p><p id="""">I still question my role in all of this. Will my storytelling, pre-dawn work sessions, constant travel, and efforts to create moments of visibility make any difference? Can I help ensure Shaun accesses the resources he needs? I don't know.</p><p id="""">But I do know I want to keep witnessing moments like these—where small connections reveal profound possibilities. Perhaps the metrics of growth and resource accumulation matter less than showing up faithfully, ready to learn how to support young people and communities in seeing themselves in leaders who walk the full journey with them.</p><p id="""">In a system ruled by power dynamics—from billions spent on ""community safety"" to media narratives that profit from fear—I'm here to understand, to build capacity, and to go where this ancient songline guides me. I'm here to keep leaning into uncertainty, to keep turning up without guarantees. Because sometimes, walking alongside others in their journey is enough to begin with.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67c01e21ccc07f6918c82fd4_IMG_8756.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p>","‍A reflection on connection, knowledge-sharing, and the weaving of futures on Stradbroke Island",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67c01e21ccc07f6918c82fd4_IMG_8756.jpg,Benjamin Knight,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664871f9e5278e33b8b4d634_BK-J.jpg,Culture and connection,5 mins,,

This special event brought together a group of researchers from the Sunshine Coast University to talk, learn, and brainstorm cool ideas, all while enjoying the beauty of nature. It was a chance for everyone to share their thoughts, work together on challenges, and think of new ways to make our communities better and healthier places. Over two amazing days, we delved into discussions about the future of A Curious Tractor's project, June's Patch, among other topics. Filled with fun activities, deep conversations, and creative projects, the camp showed us how nature and collaboration can help us find awesome solutions. Keep reading to discover all the exciting things we did and learned at the camp.<br></p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Day 1: The Confluence of Minds and Nature</strong></h3><p id="""">The day began not with the usual formalities of conferences but with an immersive introduction to the natural surroundings that would be our classroom. The essence of the camp was to explore how nature, community, and interdisciplinary collaboration could serve as catalysts for innovative solutions to pressing challenges.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Morning Engagements: Awakening to Nature's Rhythms</strong></h4><p id="""">Participants engaged in reflective walks, absorbing the tranquility and wisdom that only the natural world can offer. This grounding experience set a profound tone for the day, emphasising the intrinsic value of our connection to the environment. It was a reminder, as Lee would later reflect, of the restorative power of nature on our mental and physical well-being.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Ideation and Collaborative Sessions: Sowing the Seeds of Innovation</strong></h4><p id="""">The heart of the day was dedicated to ideation sessions where ""How Might We"" (HMW) statements sparked vibrant discussions on potential paths forward. These sessions, enriched by the diverse expertise present, highlighted the camp's core belief in the power of collective intelligence. The discussions ranged from integrating nature into educational curricula, as explored by a group focused on healthcare students, to the potential for community gardens to foster social cohesion and sustainable living.</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672ca0e448ed8deb5718ddfa_65ce88e4eea0067dbe98dbcf_Conversation_Camp-18.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt="""" id=""""></div></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672ca0e448ed8deb5718ddd2_65ce8770f9ab9829f785ceec_Conversation_Camp-21.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt="""" id=""""></div></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672ca0e448ed8deb5718dde5_65ce88bde7bcf8b32e0638a7_Conversation_Camp-7.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt="""" id=""""></div></figure><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Afternoon Reflections: From Ideas to Insights</strong></h4><p id="""">As the day progressed, the camp's ethos of learning from and with nature became ever more apparent. Participants, like Vicki, shared how the camp provided a unique space to break from the ""busy-ness"" of their schedules, allowing for deep connections and innovative thinking to flourish. The synergy of ideas was palpable, with projects like sensory gardens and community storytelling taking shape, illustrating the camp's commitment to actionable solutions that resonate with community needs and environmental sustainability.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Culminating in Collective Vision</strong></h4><p id="""">The day culminated in a shared visioning session where the seeds of the day's discussions were gathered into a collective mosaic of possibilities. Co-facilitator Nic's insights underscored the importance of such gatherings in seeding ideas and fostering a community of practice that is deeply connected to the environment and each other.</p><p>As daylight settled into a cool dim co-facilitator Barbara ran a pre-dinner activity by drawing from her deep experience in nature base fundraising. From a sustainability quiz to heartful question and answers it was the perfect ending to a day filled with joy and learning.</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672ca0e448ed8deb5718dded_65ce8787777a813a135d586f_Conversation_Camp-24.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt="""" id=""""></div></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672ca0e448ed8deb5718dde1_65ce88d13778e0eb615f1fa6_Conversation_Camp-22.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt="""" id=""""></div></figure><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Reflecting on Day 1</strong></h3><p id="""">As the first day of the Conversation Camp drew to a close, participants were left with a renewed sense of purpose and a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living things.

The first offical Dad.Lab brought together fathers from diverse backgrounds to connect, learn, and grow as a community while applying an innovative mindset to the challenges and opportunities of fatherhood.</p><p id=""b6cc8b49-5379-427f-a1ba-43dd7b06a739"">Recently, the first group of Dad.Lab participants spent a few days at Black Cockatoo Valley for a transformative two-day experience. Through activities like nature walks, creating Dad bios and posters, and building ""soil networks"" on living tables, the fathers discovered the power of connection and collaboration.</p><p id=""b408ce2a-a9e4-483d-af19-16a1be30eef1"">Chris, a Dad.Lab participant, shared a realisation: ""Beyond practical, actionable insights, a profound realisation has been the sense of belonging. I've encountered what it means to feel seen as a Dad, a sensation previously foreign to me.""</p><p id=""f4a2ae6f-5115-42d8-86c3-8450eaba694a"">As Dad.Lab grows, we envision a future where these seeds of change inspire a wider movement of fathers supporting fathers. By embracing open sharing and collaboration, we believe we can cultivate a world where fathers are empowered, connected, and thriving.</p><p id=""4ce42b99-2a53-4428-a134-d05b4ed4ebab"">Stay tuned for updates on Dad.Lab's progress and opportunities to get involved.

It's a universal language that allows us to express the inexpressible, to connect across differences, and to envision new possibilities for our world.</p><p id=""46fc8856-f011-46f2-a028-86f00b077252"">In this edition of the Creative Corner, we're thrilled to showcase a project that embodies this transformative power of art: The Confessional.</p><div data-type=""regular"" data-title="""" data-source=""[]"" data-link="""" data-style="""" data-alt="""" data-src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd7cf652a77127db14a2_0290fd49-98b4-4500-834b-1a733b079221.webp"" data-format=""image"" id=""17ed3cea-051b-4fd5-8c6d-45429af841b4"" class=""clear-both mx-auto""><figure><picture><img type=""regular"" link="""" title="""" alt="""" id=""17ed3cea-051b-4fd5-8c6d-45429af841b4"" source="""" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd7cf652a77127db14a2_0290fd49-98b4-4500-834b-1a733b079221.webp""></picture><figcaption class=""pt-2 block caption-text""></figcaption></figure></div><p id=""fee6f3b6-0c4c-4fdf-9eea-b655a5f29e5f"">The Confessional is the brainchild of our very own Nic, who has been pouring his heart and soul into this project for the past several months. It all began with a vision: to create a safe, sacred space where people could come to share their stories, their secrets, and their deepest truths.</p><p id=""b8f2397b-9cc8-44e4-b38b-05ffc94e2887"">To bring this vision to life, Nic started with an unexpected canvas: a horse trailer. Over countless hours, he worked to transform this humble vehicle into a work of art. He painted the exterior with vibrant, swirling colors that seem to dance and come alive in the sunlight. Each brushstroke is a testament to the care, the creativity, and the passion that Nic has poured into this project.</p><p id=""28d297f8-dd6d-4dd1-ab4b-e4f6435ef98a"">But The Confessional is more than just a beautiful object. It's an invitation to connection, to vulnerability, and to the power of shared storytelling. When you step inside, you're enveloped in a space that feels at once intimate and expansive. It's a place where the walls seem to whisper with the echoes of all the stories that have been shared within them.</p><p id=""ac61e2d0-af69-4281-9e10-4535b0840c70"">Through The Confessional, Nic is creating a space for our community to engage in the profound, transformative act of authentic expression. He's reminding us that when we have the courage to share our truths, we open the door to empathy, to healing, and to the realization that we are not alone in our struggles and our triumphs.</p><p id=""3b9fb533-91a8-488d-bc32-562f34ec94e1"">As you look at the images of The Confessional, we invite you to reflect on your own relationship with art and expression. How has creativity helped you to process, to heal, to connect with others and with yourself? What stories or truths are you longing to express?</p><p id=""04517b03-ac2d-43a8-8a2a-032c5727490b"">We believe that every member of our community has a unique creative voice, and we want to celebrate and amplify those voices. So, we invite you to share your own artwork, poetry, music, or any other form of creative expression with us. Send us your creations, and we'll feature a selection in future editions of the Creative Corner.</p><p id=""9ef2be9d-6f76-4073-af30-e29f903bc63c"">Together, let's continue to harness the power of art to create a more connected, compassionate, and colourful world.</p><div data-ver=""2"" data-format=""gallery"" data-title="""" id=""1abc3a37-b96b-4687-9d13-fd1a1e6e9f83"" class=""box-border""><div class=""gallery-row gallery-card""><div style=""flex: 1.5 1 0%"" class=""gallery-image""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd8e0c522f15e3605f63_44215f28-27f6-4907-bc76-a8d2dcce102c.webp""></div><div style=""flex: 1.5 1 0%"" class=""gallery-image""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd8e0c522f15e3605f43_e8e95d26-f178-4e82-b80b-07abfdaf5b37.webp""></div><div style=""flex: 1.5 1 0%"" class=""gallery-image""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd8e0c522f15e3605f4b_ea34a1aa-ca9f-4058-945f-31a49adbc532.webp""></div></div><div class=""gallery-row gallery-card""><div style=""flex: 1.5 1 0%"" class=""gallery-image""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd8e0c522f15e3605f66_350e94ec-2e71-47b0-9e1e-aa7abd67b0b8.webp""></div><div style=""flex: 1.5 1 0%"" class=""gallery-image""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd8e0c522f15e3605f47_ee617c5f-e564-4a11-a06b-e10aff3b3ee5.webp""></div><div style=""flex: 0.6666666666666666 1 0%"" class=""gallery-image""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd8e0c522f15e3605fcc_11183469-70fc-471d-aea5-de766b57de1c.webp""></div></div><div class=""gallery-row gallery-card""><div style=""flex: 1.5 1 0%"" class=""gallery-image""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd8e0c522f15e3605f77_75ae8af6-a5af-4d17-8867-ef6f250c288c.webp""></div><div style=""flex: 1.5 1 0%"" class=""gallery-image""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664ddd8e0c522f15e3605f4f_5afca60a-3146-4ace-9a7f-f74f7dc35978.webp""></div></div></div><p id=""a1af3fe1-85d0-4f90-9b09-b2520ff56f79"">P.S.

We've seen it in the stories people have shared, in the ideas contributed, and in the enthusiasm shown for the work we're doing together.</p><p id=""9f3fa551-f934-40b1-a9ca-b770b9f7e509"">We've been moved by the way people have come together to support one another, to lift up each other's voices, and to collaborate towards a shared vision of a more just, compassionate, and sustainable world. In a time when it's easy to feel isolated and disconnected, we have been shown incredible resilience and vitality that can comes from nurturing our roots and tending to our collective soil.</p><p id=""1c1c1834-66c7-44c2-8266-ba2c6dd01243"">As farmers, we know that the work of cultivating change is an ongoing process.

We believe that by listening to their stories, their insights, and their aspirations, we can co-create solutions that are more effective, more relevant, and more sustainable.</p><p id=""1678feb7-aad8-474b-8424-ffa10f041cd3"">Over the next 6-12 months, we'll be experimenting with a wide range of ideas born from art, creativity, and the lived experiences of the young people we serve. We're committed to investing our efforts in the most promising initiatives – those that have the potential to make a real, tangible difference in the lives of young people and their communities. From innovative employment programs and culturally grounded mentorship to holistic wellness support and beyond, our aim is to create pathways for more young people to feel welcomed, valued, and empowered within their communities.</p><p id=""9e471462-0c78-471e-b563-96a6aa7973ac"">As we nurture these seeds of change, we invite you to join us in tending to the soil of youth justice reform.

Not for work - just because you could. Pay a few bolivianos, walk through the gates, and suddenly you're in this... parallel universe.</p><p id="""">Families lived inside. Not visiting - <em id="""">living</em>. Kids playing in courtyards. Inmates running restaurants, shops, even a hotel where tourists could stay overnight. I bought cocaine from a guy in the prison courtyard (I was young and stupid), ate lunch in a prisoner-run cafeteria, watched children kick a football against prison walls while their fathers watched.</p><p id="""">It was chaotic. Problematic. Definitely not something to romanticise. The wealthy prisoners had decent cells; the poor ones slept in squalor. Violence happened. Corruption was baked in.</p><p id="""">But here's what cracked open in my brain: justice didn't have to equal isolation. Punishment didn't require removing someone from all human contact and possibility. The system we built in Australia - concrete boxes, extraction, the elimination of variables that might become weapons or hope - wasn't inevitable. It was <em id="""">chosen</em>.</p><p id="""">I didn't know what to do with that realisation. But it lodged in me like a splinter.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:635px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""635px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/68e56bf174fd730d4b0a0a54_1300_dsc4675.jpg.webp"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id=""""><strong id="""">Learning what extraction actually does</strong></p><p id="""">Before I&nbsp;left Australia to travel the world, I fell into 24-hour youth work in Armidale and Newcastle (2004-2006). Residential care, crisis accommodation, the full catastrophe. I was barely older than some of the kids, and I was supposed to be the stable one.</p><p id="""">What I learned: every young person who cycled through was there because multiple systems had already failed them. School had suspended them. Family had fractured. Housing had disappeared. And our response? Wait until crisis, then intervene with more extraction.</p><p id="""">Take them out of their environment. Put them somewhere ""safe."" Wonder why they keep returning to the only thing that feels real.</p><p id="""">I started noticing: every intervention increased distance between the young person and their community. We called it protection. But it looked a lot like practice for prison.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Queensland: Where reintegration revealed itself as theatre</strong></p><p id="""">By 2010, I was working with Queensland Corrective Services, running programs in remote communities and watching young people try to return from detention. Everyone used the word ""reintegration"" - it was in every policy document, every funding application.</p><p id="""">But you can't reintegrate someone into something they were never integrated with in the first place.</p><p id="""">We'd extracted them from communities already fractured by colonisation, poverty, and systemic disadvantage. Put them in detention where they learned the specific frequency of institutional despair. Then dumped them back with a case plan and called it support.</p><p id="""">I spent three years facilitating programs, developing the Positive Futures initiative, creating films for people transitioning out. Over 300 people completed the programs. Some made it. Many didn't. Not because they lacked motivation, but because we'd designed a system where failure was the most probable outcome.</p><p id="""">In the Gulf communities - Doomadgee, Mornington Island, Normanton - I saw reintegration trying to happen. Young people wanting to change. Communities ready to support them. But the system architecture worked against every good intention.</p><p id="""">The Bolivia question kept returning: <em id="""">Is any of this extraction necessary?</em></p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1594px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1594px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/68e572c458b46d025bdba04d_Screenshot%202025-10-08%20at%206.05.58%E2%80%AFam.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id=""""><strong id="""">Spain: Proof that transformation isn't theoretical</strong></p><p id="""">Fast forward to 2024. Nicholas and I traveled to Spain to visit Diagrama Foundation facilities. We'd read about them, studied the outcomes, but nothing prepared me for walking through those doors.</p><p id="""">Maria's room had sunset-coloured walls. A pillow on her bed said ""A Mi Hija"" - tomy daughter. Family photos covered one wall. A cordless phone sat on her desk - she could call her grandmother anytime. Her case worker talked to her about architecture school, about what she wanted to build when she got out in three months.</p><p id="""">This was classified as Level 4 maximum security. Maria had committed what Queensland would call serious violent offence. In Australia, she'd be in solitary, medicated, counting down years.</p><p id="""">Here, she was learning AutoCAD.</p><p id="""">When I showed her photos of Brisbane Youth Detention Centre - the concrete platforms, the mesh, the steel fixtures - she went quiet for thirty seconds. Then asked if I was showing her an adult prison.</p><p id="""">""No,"" I told her. ""That's for kids your age.""</p><p id="""">She almost started crying. Not for herself - for them. For Australian kids she'd never meet, living in conditions she couldn't comprehend even after doing what she'd done.</p><p id="""">""But how do they learn?"" she asked. ""How do they become different people?""</p><p id="""">I stood there trying to explain that we spend $859,589 annually per child to ensure they <em id="""">don't</em> become different people. That recidivism is a feature, not a bug. That trauma is the curriculum.</p><p id="""">She listened like I was telling a ghost story. Then said: ""That's not justice. That's just revenge that costs a lot of money.""</p><p id="""">Out of the mouths of Spanish teenagers in maximum security facilities.</p><p id="""">I walked through five Diagrama centres over two weeks. Every one felt like Wonderland - not perfect, but <em id="""">possible</em>. Staff talked about futures like they existed. Young people learned trades, completed education, maintained family connections. Hope wasn't an aspiration; it was operational.</p><p id="""">Then I'd fly back to Australia, visit detention centres in Brisbane and Canberra, and feel the hope drain out of the air the moment I walked through the gates.</p><p id="""">The gap wasn't resources.

We'd been doing this work for months - traveling to remote communities, building furniture with Elders and young people, listening more than talking.</p><p id="""">On the drive back, exhausted and covered in sawdust, something broke open.</p><p id="""">I told Nicholas: ""I need to be braver. I'm writing articles, sharing statistics, having meetings. But the gap between what I'm saying and what I'm <em id="""">seeing</em> feels cowardly.""</p><p id="""">The Bolivia prison showed me justice could be radically different. Twenty years of youth work showed me extraction doesn't work. Spain proved transformation is operational, not theoretical. And here I was, still being reasonable. Still using policy language. Still playing the game.</p><p id="""">""I need to use art,"" I said. ""I need to own something so I can dedicate myself to a vision.""</p><p id="""">The idea arrived fully formed: buy a shipping container. Give people 10 minutes to <em id="""">feel</em> what Brisbane detention actually feels like. Then 10 minutes in Diagrama.

I wanted them to see: when something matters enough, you don't wait for permission. You buy the containers. You learn to wire lights. You get your hands dirty.</p><p id="""">I chose the exact frequency of fluorescent lights (120 Hz - the one that seeps into your molars). The precise colour of concrete. The specific grade of steel mesh. Not to be dramatic, but to be <em id="""">accurate</em>. Because if people don't feel it in their nervous system, they won't understand why we need to blow the whole thing up and start over.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Young people as architects, not subjects</strong></p><p id="""">Then we brought in young people through Interlace Advisory - Kate Bjur and G Rangiawha connecting us with Isaiah and others who'd survived the system.

He picked up something sharp and started scratching the walls - not vandalism, but archaeology in reverse. Leaving evidence of the future in marks that mirror the past.</p><p id="""">Two of them had been in rooms identical to Room 1.

Six am arrivals met with breakfast ready, coffee hot. Nine am bringing second breakfast, what Henry called with characteristic humour: <em id="""">""Good bunch of fellas.

Not to charity or intervention, but to what becomes possible when community vision leads and others simply show up with tools, ready to listen, ready to follow, ready to witness resilience transforming itself into futures that honour both memory and possibility.</p><p id="""">In these margins where official histories fail, the Bloomfield family writes their own story - one nail, one beam, one shared meal at a time.

It's a path that demands the courage to speak, yet the wisdom to listen; the fortitude to act, yet the compassion to empathise. As I pen down these words, the world outside is a theatre of contradictions. Votes are being cast—simple 'yes' or 'no' checkboxes that somehow are expected to encapsulate our complex moral landscapes. Wars rage on in distant lands, their reverberations unsettling the very ground we stand upon. And here, in our microcosms, the chasm between abundance and need widens, almost as if mocking our shared humanity.</p><p>It's overwhelming, isn't it? The weight of the world's woes can stifle our voices, drown them in the sea of collective noise. We're often led astray by the cacophonous opinions of those around us, diminishing the potency of our individual voices, urging us to follow the crowd into an abyss of moral compromise.</p><p>Yet, here's the paradox: sometimes our voice, when finally unleashed, can be a double-edged sword. It can sever the ties that bind us to family, friends, and community. It can invite a torrent of vitriol, both online and in the flesh, making us question the very act of speaking out. It's a precarious balance, one that leaves us teetering on the edge of action and inaction, speech and silence.</p><p>Doing nothing is often not an option; the world's stage is not one that tolerates passive spectators. But choosing where to lend your voice, where to invest your emotional and moral capital—that is the crux. It's a choice that requires not just bravery but also empathy, the ability to step into another's shoes and see the world through a lens tinted with compassion and understanding.</p><div data-type=""regular"" data-title=""<p>Photo by <a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@fakurian?utm_source=Storipress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit?utm_source=storipress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit&quot;>Milad Fakurian</a> / <a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=storipress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit&quot;>Unsplash</a></p>"" data-source=""[]"" data-link="""" data-style="""" data-alt=""n the world we live in, every small decision can set off a chain reaction, much like dominos, influencing the significant events in our lives.

I am but a humble wanderer, searching for my place in this intricate web of existence. Yet, I yearn for the courage to say what I believe, to stand against the tides of popular opinion when my soul urges me to do so. And if I err, let me have the humility to admit it, for the path to wisdom is paved with the bricks of our mistakes.</p><p>So, as the world turns and decisions loom large, I cast my vote for 'Yes.' I cannot, in good conscience, support the wars tearing apart the fabric of communities in Israel and Ukraine. I beseech those in positions of power to recognize their role in sculpting a more equitable world. And above all, I hope that our dialogues can transcend the pettiness of name-calling, the futility of violence, and be imbued with the essence of empathy and understanding.</p><p>For in the end, it is not just bravery that we need, but a bravery laced with empathy—a courage that listens as much as it speaks, that acts not just with resolve but also with compassion.</p><p>With a heart full of hope and a soul yearning for peace,</p><p data-sp-article-end=""PP4KPPDEZ.10"">A Fellow Traveler</p>

It stretches and breathes, unfolds in layers that connect the boomerangs he crafted with old fellas at nineteen to the housing revolution he's leading today. In his presence, you understand that wisdom isn't measured in minutes but in generations, that true learning requires a patience most of us have forgotten how to hold.</p><p id="""">""My name Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla,"" he begins, ""I'm Warumungu, I grew up in Tennant and I got ties from my father in Tennant Creek. One of the Traditional Owners, I&nbsp;have connection to Tennant Creek through from my father's mother, so it was my grandmother's and my grandfather a little bit north, north of Tennant Creek and I got connection also from from my mother's side, around Hermannsburg.""</p><p id="""">This is how real introductions work - not just a name, but a constellation of relationships, a mapping of belonging that reaches both backwards and forwards through time.</p><p id="""">When Jimmy speaks about Wilya Janta, the housing project where he serves as chairperson, his words carry the weight of centuries of others making decisions for his people. </p><p id="""">""Once you look at when they came out of missions or out of... when white man first came to here, they moved us around like cattle, you know, and then sheep. And when we were moving in these places, they were non-Indigenous people. These white people were making decisions for us mob. And then over 75, 70 years or 80 years, someone's been doing something for us mob. Then building something and making decisions for us mob, even when the first contact with whitefella, someone else been making decisions for us mob. So we got to break that cycle.""</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/686ba03110d360f05a524cce_20250702-IMG_8000.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">And Wilya Janta is breaking that cycle. Not with grand pronouncements or government initiatives, but with the radical act of asking Aboriginal people what kind of houses they want to live in. Houses that understand ceremony, that accommodate family structures that don't fit nuclear Western models, that work with the climate rather than against it.</p><p id="""">""These houses are not right,"" Jimmy says of the current housing stock. It's not a complaint - it's a diagnosis. And more importantly, it's followed by solution: ""Indigenous people want to have mob in to design their own house.""</p><p id="""">There's a moment in our conversation where Jimmy's voice shifts, carries an edge of something between bewilderment and knowing exactly where the money goes.</p><p id="""">""As a Traditional Owner for this country, there's programs and there's a lot of money going into our town, but we've got very little to show for it. So what I'm saying is, as a traditional owner, I think a lot of people benefiting from Aboriginal people in this town and these are non-Indigenous people. These are organisations that come from down New South Wales, Victoria, somewhere like that.""</p><p id="""">""As Indigenous people, our strong points are not pencil and paper,"" Jimmy explains. ""Our strengths is our culture, our country, you know, and our language. Why aren't this implemented in any of these billions of dollars programs?""</p><p id="""">""Say the Youth Justice program. I don't see these, I don't know where the money's going. There's like $3 billion that came in the last three years in Tennant. I don't know where that going. But also every year we got ceremony that happens here and surrounding Tennant Creek. We got native title and extinguished native title in Tennant Creek, and the native title, and we got freehold.

How do you spend billions addressing problems while systematically excluding the solutions that already exist in community, in culture, in the knowledge systems that have sustained life on this continent for over 65,000 years?</p><p id="""">Sometimes the entire dysfunction of a system reveals itself in a single moment. For brother of Jimmy, Norman Frank, that moment came when he had solar panels installed on his roof through Original Power and Wilya Janta's advocacy - the first community housing tenant in the NT to have solar. But there was a catch: he couldn't turn them on.</p><p id="""">""He wanted to hit the switch, but he couldn't,"" Jimmy tells me. ""He had to go through hoops and procedures... They didn't let him have the power.""</p><p id="""">Here was a man with the solution to his power poverty literally sitting on his roof, generating electricity from the abundant Central Australian sun, and he had to wait for a Minister to fly up from Darwin to ceremonially flip a switch he could have flipped himself. If you want to understand the infantilisation of Indigenous people in this country, start there - with a grown man not being trusted to turn on his own power.</p><p id="""">Throughout our conversation, I'm struck by how Jimmy teaches without teaching, how he creates space for understanding to emerge rather than forcing it. When I ask clumsy questions about why Indigenous-led solutions haven't happened before, he doesn't lecture. Instead, he paints a picture: ""When white man first came here, they moved us around like cattle.""</p><p id="""">This is pedagogy rooted in respect for the listener's ability to understand, to connect dots, to feel the weight of history without having it explained in patronising detail. It's a generosity of spirit that assumes the best of the learner while never compromising the truth of what needs to be told.</p><p id="""">When he speaks about the young fellas he works with, about ceremony and culture, about the dance groups and the arts collective Burruja, you see how knowledge moves in his world - not through curricula or formal instruction, but through presence, through doing, through the patient accumulation of understanding that comes from showing up, again and again.</p><p id="""">""I really like your project,"" Jimmy says about the work we're doing with washing machines designed for remote communities. But what he's really endorsing isn't the machines - it's the approach. Simple rather than complicated. Built to last rather than break. Designed with actual use patterns in mind rather than urban assumptions.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/686ba04c17d329bcecb635e2_20250702-IMG_8034.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">But then he offers something more: a vision of how stories themselves can become sovereign. When we discuss creating systems where people own their own narratives, where cultural knowledge is protected and controlled by those who hold it, his response cuts to the heart of it: ""I'm all for people making a difference and making it easy, and then empowering our people... but I got an issue with someone using our word to benefit themself.""</p><p id="""">This is the crux of it - the difference between extraction and exchange, between taking stories and creating platforms for stories to be shared on their own terms.</p><p id="""">What Jimmy has taught me, more than anything, is about time. </p><p id="""">Not clock time or project time or funding-cycle time, but the kind of deep time required for real understanding. The time it takes to see patterns across generations, to understand how a conversation about washing machines connects to sovereignty, how a solar panel switch embodies decades of disempowerment.</p><p id="""">""I grew up in childhood out in the bush with my father,"" he tells me, ""learned a lot of tradition and life, and that sort of helped me on my life journey."" This learning wasn't a curriculum or a program - it was life itself, knowledge absorbed through presence, through watching, through being guided by those who came before.</p><p id="""">This is what we - white Australia - have to understand. The work of walking together isn't a project or an initiative. It's a fundamental reorientation to time, to learning, to our place in a story that started long before we arrived. It requires us to shut up and listen, to follow rather than lead, to understand that the solutions we seek already exist in the communities we've systematically ignored.</p><p id="""">Jimmy speaks of his work with quiet pride - the cultural liaison role, the arts practice that started with those old fellas when he was nineteen, the way he helps ceremony continue, the youth he guides. But he also speaks of exhaustion, of fighting the same fights over and over, of watching money flow around but never quite to where it's needed.</p><p id="""">Yet still he shows up. Still he teaches those of us willing to learn. Still he works to ensure that the next generation of Aboriginal kids have ""country and home to go back to.""</p><p id="""">This is what reconciliation actually looks like - not grand gestures or formal apologies, but the daily work of reshaping systems, of creating space for Indigenous leadership, of learning to value different kinds of knowledge. It's understanding that when we make this journey, we're not doing anyone a favour. We're saving ourselves from the poverty of a worldview that sees only one way of being in the world.</p><p id="""">As NAIDOC Week 2025 unfolds, I carry Jimmy's words with me: ""We need to be empowered ourself here and then held accountable."" This is a statement of what should be obvious. That people have the right to make decisions about their own lives. That the world's oldest continuing culture might have something to teach the rest of us. That the future we need already exists in the knowledge of those we've pushed to the margins.</p><p id="""">The invitation is there, carried in every story Jimmy shares, every patient explanation, every moment he takes to help someone like me understand. The question is whether we have the humility to accept it, the patience to learn properly, and the courage to reimagine our systems based on what we discover.</p><p id="""">In that different quality of time that Jimmy inhabits, where past and future fold into present action, where ceremony and solar panels and washing machines all connect in a web of community care, there's a richness of being that our rushing world has forgotten.</p><p id="""">This NAIDOC Week, may we all slow down enough to glimpse it.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">With deep gratitude to Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla for his time, teaching, and trust.

We're guided by the spirit of innovation, embodied in the words: ""I don't know where I'm going from here, but I promise it won't be boring."" (David Bowie)</p><h2 id="""">The Power of Action</h2><p id="""">When uncertainty looms and doubts creep in, we've discovered a fundamental truth: action is the key that unlocks possibility. It's not always about grand gestures or revolutionary breakthroughs. Often, it's the simple act of reaching out – a thoughtful message to a community member, jotting down a nascent idea, or engaging in a conversation that bridges diverse perspectives.</p><p id="""">At other times, it's about embracing boldness – challenging conventions, questioning assumptions, and daring to implement audacious ideas. We dig deep into the core of our mission, reassess our approaches, and plant seeds of meaningful change.</p><h2 id="""">The PTO: Our Engine of Impact</h2><p id="""">In this journey of action and innovation, we've developed a powerful tool – the PTO (Power Take-Off). More than just a mechanical concept, it's become our philosophy for driving change. Like a tractor's PTO that transfers power to various implements, our approach channels our energy, resources, and knowledge into diverse initiatives.</p><p id="""">Imagine a tractor not just tilling fields, but powering a wide array of change-making tools. That's our PTO – a dynamic system for amplifying impact, taking the raw power of our curiosity and transforming it into tangible, multi-faceted change.</p><h2 id="""">A Constellation of Initiatives</h2><p id="""">We're learning to harness this power effectively. One day, we're driving a youth justice initiative, amplifying unheard voices. The next, we're nurturing June's Patch, a healing garden for healthcare workers. Our energy flows into digital storytelling, community engagement, and ideas still taking shape.</p><p id="""">Some of these projects will have far-reaching impacts. Others might be smaller in scale but no less important. Each initiative, regardless of its size, moves us forward in our mission to cultivate meaningful change.</p><h2 id="""">An Invitation to Curious Minds</h2><p id="""">So here we are, curious change-makers in a field of infinite possibility. We may not have all the answers, but we have our PTO, our commitment to action, and a promise that our journey will be anything but ordinary.</p><p id="""">To those who've been part of our journey – thank you. Your insights and support fuel our efforts and light our path.</p><p id="""">And to those yet to join – there's a place for you in this endeavor. Together, let's power a revolution of empathy, nurture seeds of change, and create a future that inspires and transforms.</p><p id="""">After all, while we may not know exactly where we're going, we're committed to making the journey meaningful, impactful, and far from boring.</p><p id="""">Onward, fellow curious souls!</p><p id="""">‍</p>","At A Curious Tractor, we believe in the power of action to transform uncertainty into possibility.

The red earth stretches endlessly beneath leaden skies, a reminder of the deep history and continuing culture of the Kalkadoon people who have been custodians of this land for tens of thousands of years.</p><p id="""">It's been ten years since my time running Corrective Services programs in the Lower Gulf, working through alcohol abuse and family violence. Those three years taught me the profound importance of connection to LORE, to community, to positive identity. But returning now to Kalkadoon Country, supporting Brodie's journey, I'm struck by how much I still have to learn.</p><p id="""">Brodie picks me up from the airport, his energy infectious. We're here to work through his next phase of business development, supported by a Sport and Rec Queensland grant for three Camps on Country in 2025. The meeting with Sport and Rec feels like planting new seeds with strong roots. Paul Slater's presence - a respected Kalkadoon man who will mentor Brodie monthly - adds weight and wisdom to the conversation about mapping cultural protocols and partnerships.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6741820fb849f43e1b9b6902_67417cd3d0a900ec3a2a0edd_IMG_3547.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">Walking Brodie's World</h2><p id="""">As we drive through Kalkadoon Country, every second car holds a friendly face calling out to Brodie. Young people gravitate to his energy, hands reaching out for high fives, voices eager to share stories. These aren't superficial connections - they're threads in a web of trust he's woven through consistent presence and genuine care.</p><h2 id="""">Wisdom from Uncle George</h2><p id="""">Sitting with Uncle George, a respected Kalkadoon elder, his words cut straight to the heart of what makes Brodie's work significant: ""All the kids know Brodie and that's a big thing. He's only young and he can go a lot further."" As a former Police Liaison Officer and custodian of cultural knowledge, Uncle George's validation carries special weight.</p><p id="""">His insights about youth work come from decades of walking between worlds: ""You can't just take people out bush for a week or two and expect they're going to change. These kids, a lot of kids will take years to change."" He speaks about the importance of targeting the right young people, especially the leaders: ""You've got to know which kids... especially around here, you've got a lot of leaders, a lot of kids that lead other kids. That's the kids you grab.""</p><p id="""">His reflection on how Kalkadoon Country has changed carries deep meaning: ""When I was young here it was good here... Everyone got on. You could sleep outside, you could leave the doors open, everyone trusted anyone... Ever since the phones come in and all that, life's changed. And it's changed for the worst, not for the best.""</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1333px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1333px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6741820fb849f43e1b9b690b_67417cf171b1ca39846a8ee4_IMG_3759.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">The Men's Shed: Practical Wisdom</h2><p id="""">At the Men's Shed, Gary's practical wisdom emerges through action rather than words. As Men's Shed Coordinator for Nook and Tardy, ourari, our children and family centre, he has created more than just a workspace - it's a sanctuary where healing happens through doing.</p><p id="""">The shed hums with possibility. ""We just basically do woodwork,"" Gary says with characteristic understatement, before revealing the deeper purpose. They started with pallet work, creating beds and medicine cabinets for the elderly ""where they can lock it up."" Then came the bike program, breathing new life into cycles salvaged from Townsville's floods. ""That container at the front, that was full of bikes... Took us to get rid of all them bikes, all the kids that are walking.""</p><p id="""">But it's more than just making things. The shed serves as a crucial transition point for men seeking new directions. ""We get the men from CASH, that's our diversion recovery centre. Some come out of the jail, come straight into that system,"" Gary explains. These men find their way to the shed, where they're welcomed without judgment into what Gary calls ""a real honour circle.""The innovation in Gary's approach lies in seeing possibilities where others might see waste. The wire work program emerged from this vision - ""because you can find work wire anywhere in the community man you know."" These creations, from totems to fencing, offer pathways to income for men rebuilding their lives.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1333px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1333px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6741820fb849f43e1b9b6911_67417d0a9d885f20f4ec1970_IMG_3570.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Perhaps the shed's most powerful initiative was the suicide prevention march that began six years ago. ""We was the only Indigenous men in Australia to do a suicide march,"" Gary recalls with quiet pride. The impact rippled across the country, inspiring similar movements. In Mount Luby, where they lost 22 people in one month, a men's group grew from three to 250 members after following the shed's example.</p><p id="""">The space serves multiple purposes - a refuge (""I'd rather you run here than stay there and bash them""), a learning center (teaching welding and trades), and a connection point where men find purpose through practical work. Success stories emerge naturally: ""Out of the 10 years of me, I think two of them were in the mines. One's got a trade as a boilermaker, now he's flying in and flying out from Townsville.""</p><p id="""">When we discuss the create bed project, Gary immediately sees its potential through the lens of community need. ""We've got a lot of homeless people down the river and that's all they is mattresses... diseases mattress material you know the scabies you know all the bed sores and everything."" He envisions not just providing beds but teaching people to make them - ""give me a hand, make it, you know, and they can take the skill to make it.""</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6741820fb849f43e1b9b68ff_67417d23ac6ba375f83ec6d7_IMG_3600.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">The shed's latest project, the Red Benches initiative, exemplifies their approach to complex community issues. Working with young people from T2S and Flexi school, they're creating visible symbols of domestic violence awareness while teaching practical skills.

Gary at the Men's Shed pointed us toward Good Shepherd Church, where an unexpected reunion with Aunty Dolly. A decade dissolves in an instant. Aunty Dolly, who once helped countless community members return to Country for sorry business and health-related trips, opens the door. Her initial uncertainty breaks into recognition, and suddenly we're connected across time. These are the moments that remind me of the deep relationships that hold communities together.led to our first breakthrough. Her immediate response of ""just go for it"" when hearing about the create bed idea opened the first door. </p><p id="""">The next day, after checking with Father Mick who directed us to Coles, we found ourselves negotiating for crates - initially just borrowing them with a promise to return. In true community spirit, we ended up giving back more than we borrowed, turning a temporary loan into a gift that kept giving.</p><p id="""">The real magic happened in the building. With Mark, the experience transcended simple furniture construction. Here was a man who'd been sleeping on a bed frame with just a piece of wood the night before. Working alongside Brodie and other men who trust and support him, we created more than just a bed - we built connection, dignity, and possibility. Mark's quiet pride in having a create bed ""for as long as he wants"" spoke volumes about the project's deeper impact.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6741820fb849f43e1b9b68f2_6741814ca10bc07c237402c5_IMG_3712.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6741820fb849f43e1b9b68ef_674181a022e3b1a9fcc9d165_IMG_3727.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">The energy continued in Pioneer, where we turned bed-building into a family event.

At the Flexi school on Kalkadoon Country, young people flock to him, eager for connection. The teachers implore him to come more often, to create programs that mentor youth, connect them to the gym, and then guide them on country.</p><p id="""">Uncle George's words about Brodie's potential resonate: ""He's on the right track. But he's trying to do it himself too, like I do. And that's the thing. When you're trying to do things by yourself, it's very hard to change. If you've got another four Brodies or four of me or something, it's going to make things a lot easier.""</p><h2 id="""">The Complex Reality</h2><p id="""">Kalkadoon Country holds its contradictions openly. The billions generated by the mines cast long shadows over community poverty. At the river bed, people sleep on old mattresses and work through their trauma with wine bags and cartons of beer. Young people walk streets instead of attending school.</p><p id="""">Yet hope grows in unexpected places - in the Men's Shed's quiet work, in Aunty Joan's careful preservation of stories, in Brodie's dedicated presence with youth. As Uncle George says, ""You can stop it, I tell you right now, if you get a group of good people together.""</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6741820fb849f43e1b9b6908_67417e4122e3b1a9fcc82e5c_IMG_3855.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">A Personal Reflection</h2><p id="""">As I prepare to leave Kalkadoon Country, I'm humbled by how much I still have to learn. Most of the time when I talk about community work, I hear white people telling me what it's like in community, how I should act, what happened to them and what I need to do. I still don't know how to take this, but I stay quiet and continue to learn on country from elders, Traditional Owners and community.</p><p id="""">I feel privileged that people have opened their worlds to me across many traditional lands - from Bwgcolman (Palm Island, where many tribal groups were forcibly relocated, with Manbarra people as traditional owners), to Minjerribah (Stradbroke Island, home of the Quandamooka people), to Mparntwe (Alice Springs, home of the Arrernte people), and here on Kalkadoon Country. In each place, people have shown me protocols, walked me through ceremony and spent deep time talking through ideas and opportunities.</p><p id="""">The contrast here on Kalkadoon Country is stark - between the billions of dollars generated from mining on traditional lands and the poverty visible in parts of the community. At the river bed, people sleep on old mattresses and work through their trauma. Young people walk the streets rather than being at school. The privileged community looks down on issues that are in their face, not sure how to take action.</p><p id="""">Through A Curious Tractor, Nic and I remain deeply curious to know more while standing with community in developing, trialing and testing solutions. There will be times we get it wrong. People might growl at us. Many will disagree. But what we have are strong local people leading us in the right ways, building our understanding.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6741820fb849f43e1b9b68e8_67417e634432f21ceb133c4d_IMG_3948.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">I don't seek acceptance - that's not what this work is about. I want to offer my skills, do things with community, help when asked, and work through things I don't know. I want to walk alongside people when welcome and try to tell this story of hope, resilience and connection to Mother Earth that too many people have lost.</p><p id="""">I believe Indigenous thinking offers a way through many of the issues we face in this generation. When Aunty Joan speaks of traditional medicines, when Uncle George talks about community responsibility, when the couple from Doomadgee quietly demonstrate proper protocols - these are not just stories or rules, they're pathways to healing that have sustained people for tens of thousands of years.</p><p id="""">I want to share that thinking in the hope some will listen and reconnect with nature in the way that First Nations peoples have done since time immemorial. As Uncle George says, ""If you speak from the heart and you tell, and you say the right things and you speak the truth, people listen.""</p><p id="""">Standing here on Kalkadoon Country, watching Brodie work with young people, seeing the elders share their wisdom, witnessing the quiet strength of community connections, I understand more deeply than ever that our role is to listen first, to learn always, and to walk alongside when invited. The solutions aren't in grand gestures or outside expertise - they're in the patient work of supporting community-led change, one relationship at a time.</p><p id="""">In the end, it's about understanding that every traditional Country holds its own wisdom, its own protocols, its own ways of healing. Our job isn't to bring solutions, but to support the knowledge and leadership that already exists in community, while remaining humble enough to keep learning, growing, and changing ourselves.</p><p id="""">As I board the plane to leave, I carry these lessons with me, knowing they'll continue to teach long after this visit ends. The privilege of being welcomed into these spaces comes with responsibility - to listen well, to support wisely, and to share stories in ways that honour their depth and complexity.</p><p id="""">‍</p>","Returning to Kalkadoon Country (Mount Isa) became a profound lesson in community-led change. Supporting Brodie's evolution as a youth mentor, I witnessed wisdom flowing from two key elders: Uncle George, whose decades as a Police Liaison Officer taught him that real youth work happens through consistent presence, and Gary at the Men's Shed, whose practical approach shows how healing happens through doing. A simple create bed project wove through these conversations, transforming from initial setbacks into moments of dignity and connection - particularly when building with community members like Mark. Aunty Joan's careful preservation of cultural knowledge through her self-taught writing grounded these experiences in deeper tradition, reminding us that Indigenous wisdom offers pathways through modern challenges. As Uncle George said, ""If you speak from the heart and you tell, and you say the right things and you speak the truth, people listen"" - a guidance that proved true throughout this journey of learning and connection on Kalkadoon Country.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67417bfaac022b886ae9c643_IMG_3850.jpg,Benjamin Knight,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/65765015396cdcb6106114ad_BK-1_Square.jpg,"Young People, Culture, Knowledge, Beds",20 mins,-20.724705,139.497467

The stark contrast between what I witnessed in these centers and what I have experienced in Australian youth detention centers is both eye-opening and deeply troubling.</p><p id="""">In Australia, every visit to a youth detention center leaves me feeling depleted and haunted by the experiences of the young people there. The oppressive atmosphere, the lack of compassion and engagement between guards, educators, and young people, and the overall punitive approach all contribute to a sense of hopelessness and despair. It's clear that the current system, built on an English legacy and influenced by the US model of punishment over support and understanding, is failing our young people and our society as a whole.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6704aae0a24d71c5efe5ebcb_6704aaa0ce6e84d83ba35997_Spain-Diagrama-LR-79.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit""></div></figure><p id="""">However, my experience in Spain has shown me that there is another way. From the moment I stepped into each Diagrama center, I was struck by the positive energy, the laughter, and the strong relationships between the young people and their educators. It was evident that the young people were not just being punished, but were being given the opportunity to build resilience, develop new skills, and work towards a brighter future. The Diagrama staff had high expectations for these young people and treated them with respect, compassion, and a genuine belief in their potential.</p><p id="""">One of the most powerful moments of my visit was sitting down and talking with the young people themselves. As we discussed the conditions in Australian youth detention centers, they struggled to understand how such a punitive and dehumanizing approach could be considered acceptable or effective. They spoke about their own hopes and dreams, and the trust they had in their educators to support them on their journey. It was clear that they viewed their time in detention not as a punishment, but as an opportunity for growth and transformation.</p><p id="""">The interviews and analysis of the Diagrama model only reinforce my belief that this approach can and must be implemented in Australia. The quantitative data, such as the significantly lower recidivism rates in Diagrama centers compared to Australian youth detention centers, provide compelling evidence of the model's effectiveness. The stories and experiences shared by the young people, educators, and staff offer powerful examples of how this approach can transform lives and communities.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6704aadfa24d71c5efe5ebc8_6704aab15710143ed400267f_Spain-Diagrama-LR-64.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit""></div></figure><p id="""">Implementing the Diagrama model in Australia will undoubtedly require a significant shift in mindset, policy, and practice. It will require us to confront and challenge the deeply ingrained beliefs and systems that have perpetuated the current harmful approach to youth justice. However, the potential benefits are too great to ignore. By embracing a model that prioritizes education, rehabilitation, and positive relationships, we can create a youth justice system that not only reduces recidivism and enhances community safety but also helps young people to heal, grow, and thrive.</p><p id="""">As I reflect on my experience in Spain, I am filled with a sense of hope and determination. I know that change is possible, and that the Diagrama model offers a roadmap for how we can achieve it. By sharing my experiences and the insights gained from this visit, I hope to inspire others to join me in advocating for a more compassionate, effective, and just approach to youth justice in Australia.</p><p id="""">We owe it to our young people, our communities, and our society as a whole to do better. The time for change is now, and the Diagrama model shows us that a brighter, more hopeful future is within reach.

The trailer is divided into two distinct compartments. One side is designated for the participant who wishes to speak, while the other side features a perforated board. This board, reminiscent of traditional confessionals, allows only a limited and controlled view through its small openings.</p><p id=""88852d9d-bf7c-462a-a815-e78b11d950b7"">This careful design ensures that the person sharing their thoughts remains partially hidden, maintaining their anonymity and privacy. Yet, the small holes in the board enable a unique form of connection – the listener can sense the presence of the speaker without seeing them fully. This setup mirrors the balance of privacy and intimacy found in traditional confessionals, promoting a sense of safety and openness. The environment created by this design encourages participants to be honest and vulnerable, fostering genuine human connection and understanding.</p><p id=""9a147d4f-c3c6-4779-bcab-3f7aecbb06ff"">[Insert close-up image of the perforated board, highlighting the design that ensures partial anonymity]</p><p id=""ae8cd564-59cd-432d-9c19-ac3b8a4dbee0""><strong>Understanding Traditional Confessionals</strong></p><p id=""433cad8d-1ded-437e-b2ab-f34483a350e4"">Traditionally, a confessional is a box, cabinet, booth, or stall in which a priest in some Catholic churches sits to hear the confessions of penitents. These structures are often made of wood and are designed with a central compartment for the priest, flanked by two side compartments for the penitents. The priest's compartment is accessed through a door or curtain, providing a private space for the priest while maintaining the confidentiality of the penitents.</p><p id=""6e230197-b236-4c1c-b5fb-366c2e9cb6e8"">Each side compartment has a latticed opening through which the penitent speaks. The lattice allows for a voice to be heard clearly while keeping the identity of the penitent somewhat obscured. This design ensures that the priest is hidden from view, maintaining the anonymity of the interaction, while the penitent is partially visible to the public. This visibility provides a safeguard against any misconduct and reinforces the transparency of the sacrament.</p><p id=""cfc2e378-c62d-4f40-b28f-2931732d8bfa"">Confessionals are often intricately designed, with many finely decorated examples from the late 16th and 17th centuries found in European churches. These structures are not just functional; they often form part of the architectural and artistic heritage of the churches, with some being movable pieces of furniture and others being permanent fixtures. In modern Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican practices, confessionals may be used alongside other forms of confession and absolution, such as private confessions at the chancel rails or in reconciliation rooms. This evolution reflects a broader approach to the sacrament, accommodating different needs for privacy and personal comfort.</p><p id=""6ed6a033-5e6a-4759-8ce7-2df39d2e3891"">[Insert historical image or illustration of a traditional confessional]</p><p id=""6fe597d9-f9cc-41e8-a8d8-0507fefd5194""><strong>Inspiration from History</strong></p><p id=""1c5718c9-20d7-4e8f-a54b-e33445a02082"">Nic's confessional also draws inspiration from the history of glory holes, which were anonymous spaces primarily used by the LGBTQ+ community for discreet sexual encounters. These spaces, while controversial, provided a means for expression in a time of persecution. By reimagining this idea in a non-sexual, social context, Nic honours the past while creating a new platform for diverse voices.</p><p id=""51bd60b0-f376-46eb-9557-ed4dee99b158"">[Insert historical image or artistic representation of traditional glory holes]</p><p id=""81a0fede-5313-496f-838d-7a73d6c0b72b""><strong>Socially Engaged Practice in Action</strong></p><p id=""e2952112-aa4c-4702-877d-cc4da1b91c40"">The Confessional is a prime example of socially engaged practice, also referred to as social practice or socially engaged art. This form of art involves people and communities in debate, collaboration, or social interaction. Often organized as part of an outreach or education program, socially engaged practice prioritizes the participatory element, with the collaborative act of creation holding as much, if not more, importance than the final artwork.</p><p id=""daebca7b-664c-4a1d-af81-597f031e7430"">Tom Finkelpearl, in his book <em>What We Made: Conversations on Art and Social Cooperation</em>, describes social practice as ""art that’s socially engaged, where the social interaction is at some level the art."" This is precisely what Nick's Confessional aims to achieve – creating a space for interaction and dialogue, fostering connections, and encouraging participants to share their stories and experiences.</p><p id=""1777393d-6e48-4cc3-aafc-5e113120499d"">[Insert image of the Confessional in use, with people approaching and engaging with the space]</p><p id=""bff2d865-bd24-4081-be99-de56803f72f2""><strong>Social Practice and Activism</strong></p><p id=""f8ccdad5-06c1-40db-9f2b-999936aea4c3"">Socially engaged practice often intersects with activism, addressing political issues and aiming to integrate deeply into specific communities. Artists like Rick Lowe emphasise the importance of spending years developing relationships within the community they wish to engage. This long-term commitment ensures a deep understanding of the community's complexities and needs. The artists’ goal is to help the community work towards common goals, raise awareness, encourage conversation, and improve physical or psychological conditions.</p><p id=""56a0fadd-45f3-44ef-a652-a1545acb0c0f"">An exemplary model of this approach is the 2015 Turner Prize winners, Assemble, who collaborated with residents to improve their local area. This approach to art – prioritising social interaction and community goals – aligns perfectly with the ethos of A Curious Tractor and Nick's Confessional project.</p><p id=""8d38fcb1-a3e4-4e95-99f1-c9fb7c3ae31a""><strong>Fostering Empathy and Understanding</strong></p><p id=""26f514f1-a314-459b-ad66-7b41fcc35e83"">The Confessional will travel across Australia, offering everyone – from the homeless and doctors to experts and everyday individuals – an opportunity to share their stories. This project aims to shake up psychological and social counselling, making it more approachable and accessible. It's a place where people can unburden themselves, reflect, and connect with the community in a meaningful way.</p><p id=""597e018b-73cc-485d-b923-53dd68c40677"">[Insert image of the Confessional in use, with people approaching and engaging with the space]</p><p id=""eba1c351-0376-4dbf-9243-505a3dc1ab6f""><strong>A Bold Vision for Social Art</strong></p><p id=""5b814c53-17ec-4bc2-ab5d-abf3f31775b8"">Nic's dedication to pushing boundaries in social art is evident in this project. By developing and deploying the Confessional before it's perfect, he invites feedback and engagement from the community, ensuring the piece evolves to meet real needs. This approach reflects Nick's commitment to innovation and the belief in the transformative power of community input.</p><p id=""3beec59c-fd0d-43c4-a2ed-d75eaf8ec3c3"">[Insert candid image of Nick working on or presenting the Confessional, capturing his dedication and vision]</p><p id=""318ad229-75fd-4cc2-ae75-4dec663ffaf8""><strong>Creating Spaces for Connection</strong></p><p id=""fe30b429-eed4-4a05-9ed4-5cfee771e16e"">In essence, the Confessional by A Curious Tractor embodies the spirit of empathy, resilience, and radical innovation. It’s a testament to how creative solutions can address complex social challenges, fostering a more understanding and connected world. This project is more than an art piece; it's a movement towards greater empathy and open dialogue in our communities.</p><p data-sp-article-end=""PP4KPPDEZ.20"" id=""43ae3cc4-9960-447a-8681-5252452fbd42"">[Insert image of people engaging with the Confessional, possibly capturing a moment of interaction or reflection]</p>

I would show them how rebellious I really was. And that's exactly what I see happening with the Queensland government's current approach to youth justice.</p><p id="""">The Community Safety Plan, with its billion-dollar budget and focus on increased policing and detention, seems more concerned with appeasing voters in the lead-up to the arbitrary showboating like the Olympics than truly investing in the long-term wellbeing of our state's most vulnerable youth. It's a short-sighted, reactionary approach that fails to address the root causes of offending and instead perpetuates a cycle of harm and disadvantage.</p><p id="""">The statistics paint a grim picture. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are 24 times more likely to be in detention than their non-Indigenous counterparts, despite making up only 6% of the 10-17 year old population (AIHW, 2021). A staggering 94% of youth in detention have experienced at least one form of neglect, trauma, or abuse (AIFS, 2020). And once caught in the cycle of incarceration, 44% will return within 12 months of release (AIHW, 2020).</p><p id="""">It's clear that the current system is failing our young people, and simply doubling down on punishment and deprivation only perpetuates harm. But what if there was another way? What if we looked to the innovative thinking of successful companies to reshape our approach?</p><h1 id=""""><strong id="""">Act 1: The Reality on the Ground</strong></h1><p id="""">To understand what a reimagined youth justice system could look like, we first need to grapple with the realities facing Aboriginal young people in Queensland today. Recent research by Butcher et al. (2021) offers valuable insights from community members across regional and remote areas, where over 40% of Aboriginal youth in the justice system originate.</p><p id="""">Through in-depth interviews, a clear picture emerges of the complex web of factors driving youth offending. Poverty and unemployment are rife, with many young people struggling to meet basic needs. Intergenerational trauma from policies of forced removal and cultural dispossession continues to ripple through families and communities. Disconnection from education, country and cultural identity leaves many youth adrift.</p><p id="""">As one community member shared: ""If you don't know who you are, you don't know your identity, your sense of self, you don't see a long-term plan because why would you have aspirations in a job where no one can get to towns and the majority of people you know have been in overcrowded houses or struggling to overcome homelessness. It's not a big secret why our numbers are the way they are.""</p><p id="""">Crucially, the research also highlights the incredible strengths and resilience of Aboriginal communities – the strong kinship networks, the deep cultural knowledge, the determination to break cycles of disadvantage. But these community assets are too often overlooked or undermined by top-down, one-size-fits-all interventions.</p><p id="""">As another participant advocated, ""You need to start looking at the communities as individuals. So if you can look at a community as an individual, and sort out a case plan for that community, you're going to be fine. But don't force a program from south Sydney, metropolitan area, onto an outreach location, because they are very, very different issues, and they are different communities.""</p><h1 id=""""><strong id="""">Act 2: A New Vision</strong></h1><p id="""">So what would it look like for the Queensland government to put these community insights at the centre of a transformed youth justice agenda? To start, it would mean a fundamental shift in mindset and power dynamics.</p><p id="""">Rather than viewing youth offending through a narrow lens of individual deficits and deviance, policymakers would adopt a systems perspective – mapping out the complex interplay of structural, cultural and situational factors that shape a young person's trajectory. This holistic view would spur investment in the social determinants of youth wellbeing, such as housing, healthcare, education and employment pathways.</p><p id="""">It would also prompt a reorientation of resources from back-end detention to front-end prevention and diversion. Imagine if even a fraction of the current youth justice budget was redirected to evidence-based, community-led early intervention programs that provide mentoring, cultural connection, and wrap-around support to at-risk youth and families. The long-term social and economic returns would far outweigh the short-term political appeal of seeming 'tough on crime'.</p><p id="""">Critically, this new vision would position Aboriginal communities as essential partners in co-designing and co-delivering youth justice solutions. Policymakers would take their lead from Aboriginal Elders, organisations and young leaders, respecting their cultural authority and deep understanding of local needs and strengths. Initiatives like community-based healing circles, bush camps, and cultural mentoring would be elevated and scaled, leveraging Aboriginal ways of being and doing.</p><p id="""">Accountability would be reframed around what communities value, with success measured not just by recidivism rates but by indicators of social and emotional wellbeing, cultural identity, and community empowerment. Youth and families would be active participants in shaping programs and tracking outcomes - their voices and aspirations at the forefront.</p><h1 id="""">Act 3: A Call to Action</h1><p id="""">Achieving this vision will require courageous leadership and a willingness to challenge entrenched attitudes and practices. It means ceding power and control to those with lived experience and cultural wisdom. It means investing for the long-haul and embracing the uncertainty of innovation.</p><p id="""">But the alternative - more of the same revolving door of youth detention and despair - is unacceptable. As a society, we have a moral imperative to do better by our most vulnerable young people. And in truth, a youth justice system that heals and empowers rather than punishes and marginalises benefits us all.</p><p id="""">So to our policymakers, we say: be brave. Look beyond the next news cycle or election to the kind of Queensland we want to create for generations to come. Partner with Aboriginal communities to forge a new path guided by their knowledge and resilience. Invest in the potential of our youth, not the expansion of our prisons.</p><p id="""">And to our fellow Queenslanders: lend your voice to the call for change. Challenge the narratives of fear and retribution that drive failed policies. Champion community-led solutions and hold our leaders accountable for delivering real results.</p><p id="""">Together, we can transform youth justice from a site of trauma and stigma to a source of healing, hope and restoration. We can build a Queensland where every young person has the opportunity and support to thrive. Let us seize this moment, learn from past failings, and take inspiration from innovative frameworks to forge a more just, compassionate and effective way forward.Our kids are counting on us.</p><p id="""">‍</p>","In Queensland, our youth justice system is failing our most vulnerable young people, with a billion-dollar plan that prioritizes punishment over addressing the root causes of offending. It's time for a fundamental rethink - one that empowers Aboriginal communities, invests in prevention and healing, and sees the inherent potential in every justice-involved youth as a change-maker and leader in their own life and community.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/6632b77ffd46691c4d67d2ae_benjamink6990_this_style_of_image_3f8b23f3-8638-4160-a396-99f57a7b8f79.png,Benjamin Knight,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/65ce868b02decb22a6368b6b_BK_Photo.jpg,Youth Justice,10 mins,,

The word 'raucous' has a rich history. Derived from the Latin word ""raucus"", it originally meant ""hoarse"". Over time, it came to represent anything loud, rowdy, or disorderly. But I propose a new interpretation of the word. One that goes beyond the negative connotations and celebrates the spirit of enthusiasm, exuberance, and infectious energy.</p><p id="""">Picture this. A team meeting where ideas are being thrown around like confetti, voices competing to be heard, laughter filling the room. A raucous meeting, yes, but one filled with creativity, passion, and unbridled energy. A raucousness that encourages us to step out of our comfort zones, to speak up, to engage, to challenge, and to be challenged.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1456px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1456px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/64f18fbfed886d13a65e20d1_ET-videothumb.png"" loading=""lazy""></div><figcaption>Something we cooked up earlier</figcaption></figure><p id="""">Incorporating raucousness into our values at A Curious Tractor doesn't mean we're advocating for chaos or disorder. It is really the opposite. We want to foster an environment where this energised, lively spirit is harnessed and directed towards productive, creative ends. To this end, we are advocating for a kind of structured raucousness – a raucousness that has a box, that knows its limits.</p><blockquote id="""">But how do we strike that balance? How do we ensure that our raucous spirit doesn't spill over into disorder?</blockquote><p id="""">Testing our assumptions is key. We will start small, introducing elements of raucousness into brainstorming sessions, and external activities. We will then gather feedback, adjust, and improve. Does our raucous spirit encourage participation or stifle it? Does it foster creativity or create chaos? By closely monitoring these dynamics, we can calibrate the level of raucousness to suit our needs.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/64f27e2909a9a8a4e19e48df_Farm%20(26%20of%2035).jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div><figcaption>Nico just getting it done</figcaption></figure><p id="""">There's a certain beauty in raucousness.

Richard Cassidy pauses, reflecting on the daily challenges of creating change on Palm Island. ""But then you get some sound bites from people in the community or an elder, and they go 'oh yeah, really well like what you're doing,' and now I go, oh gosh, that's gold. I absolutely needed to hear that.""</p><p id="""">This interplay between the grinding reality of daily work and moments of affirmation characterizes the path of transformation on Palm Island. As Richard notes, ""for every good moment, there's probably 10, 15, 20 not so good moments."" Yet it's these glimpses of progress that fuel the journey forward.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/673e58c1e7bfd3e2ac5e45fd_673e57c08507b496c98c341a_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-84.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit""></div></figure><p id="""">At the heart of Richard's philosophy is a profound understanding of identity and being. ""For some people, they're doing people - they get their identity out of what they do,"" he explains. ""For others, when I call our mob, we're being people. We be, to sit and to be, and it's about occupying a place or a space in relationship to family or to country."" This distinction illuminates the challenge faced by many in the community: ""Straight away if you haven't got a job or something like that, and you're unemployed, straight away you're on the left foot. And you go, 'well, I might be unemployed.' And that takes away from who you might be.""</p><p id="""">This understanding shapes his approach to community renewal: ""How do we go from a place of brokenness where it's really hard to find who you might be because you've been displaced,"" he asks, ""to a place where you are who you are, and you know who you might be, and then you participate in that place by what you're doing?""</p><p id="""">Leading the MinggaMingga Rangers program, Richard has developed an approach that nurtures both being and doing. ""For the last 18 months to two years, I've been banging on with my team and going, 'OK, I need you to shine because if you shine, I'll look good.' But in order for them to shine, they need a whole bunch of things like encouragement and to be able to be listened to and to know where they're coming from.""</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/673e58c1e7bfd3e2ac5e460c_673e57df02647825c0a56284_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-131.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit""></div></figure><p id="""">The results manifest in quiet but powerful ways. ""I could almost taste it every now and then,"" he says, ""especially in some of the eyes of these lads when they jump in the ute and they're gone. You go, 'yep, okay.' But they come back and they're sweating and they're talking about what they've done and how excited they are.""</p><p id="""">Perhaps most significantly, Richard articulates a vision of cultural synthesis that neither clings rigidly to the past nor abandons it entirely. He describes it as two edges of a spear - traditional law on one side, mainstream obligations on the other. ""We're not going to say 'let's throw that one away, let's throw this one away,' but we're going to actually use each to inform the operation of what we do. And that'll sharpen our spear.""</p><p id="""">This approach requires careful discernment about what to ""adopt, adapt, or abandon"" - a framework passed down by Elder Uncle Graham. It's a path that demands both wisdom and courage, as illustrated by one of Richard's rangers who chose to miss sorry business to fulfill work commitments - ""an absolute huge call,"" as Richard acknowledges, but one that reflected a deeper commitment to ""push forward"" for the community's future.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1333px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1333px""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/673e58c1e7bfd3e2ac5e45f9_673e57f8de875610bbc8bdae_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-123.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit""></div></figure><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/673e58c1e7bfd3e2ac5e45f6_673e58a6336979225916073a_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-117.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit""></div></figure><p id="""">Looking at Palm Island's trajectory, Richard sees hope in the emerging generation: ""If we look at the history of Palm... to then see a small remnant of their descendants rising out of the dust of that history and just owning a space of semi-independence and autonomy and with a space of creativity and purpose and fire and energy - then you're going to go, oh yeah, there's something different about this little team.""</p><p id="""">This vision - of a community rising from historical dust with both fire and purpose, maintaining cultural strength while engaging with modern challenges - drives the daily work at the coalface. ""I'm hoping that little team will actually then grow into a bigger team,"" Richard reflects, ""and be able to almost produce a wave or a movement of change for this place.""</p><p id="""">Even as he acknowledges the weight of expectation on the ranger program and the broader community, Richard's perspective remains grounded in hope and practical action. Like the traditional protocols that guide their work - from Welcome to Country ceremonies to cultural burning practices - the path forward moves at the speed of ceremony, not commerce. It's a journey of reconnection, of finding strength in who you are before focusing on what you do, of building capability while preserving culture.</p><p id="""">In this way, every day at the coalface becomes part of a larger story of transformation - dust in the eyes, yes, but also golden moments of community recognition, young people finding their purpose, and a culture being renewed through meaningful work on country.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4000px""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/673e58c1e7bfd3e2ac5e4602_673e583745a485c94f336cf2_DJI_0187.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p>","Through his work with Palm Island's rangers, Richard Cassidy shows how meaningful change happens when young people find their identity through both cultural connection and purposeful action - creating transformation that moves at the speed of ceremony rather than commerce.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/673e5729838d6c1f678f6e90_Palm%20Island%20-%20Goods%20Low%20res-138.jpg,Benjamin Knight,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/664871f9e5278e33b8b4d634_BK-J.jpg,Culture,10 mins,-18.7345,146.5798

These organisations understand that behind the seemingly simple act of washing clothes lies a complex web of interconnected systems—dignity infrastructure, economic barriers, cultural narratives, governance failures. By aligning their diverse approaches while honoring contextual differences, they are creating a tapestry of transformation that can adapt to different environments while maintaining its essential pattern.</p><p id="""">Their decentralised approach offers a powerful model for social change in our complex world. Rather than attempting to impose a single solution, they are creating a network of approaches that can respond to local conditions while connecting to global learning.

Not absent, but quiet in the way that deep waters run silent, processing, witnessing, feeling the collective pull toward conversations that diminish rather than expand our humanity. Every government press release celebrating another youth arrest, every politician performing ""tough on crime"" theatre, every comment thread dissolving into tribal warfare over who deserves safety and who deserves punishment feels like watching a society choose the smallest version of itself.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">And I've been asking myself: How do we speak truth into a world that seems increasingly committed to its own mythology of scarcity and separation?</em></p><h2 id="""">The Personal Ecology of Systemic Transformation</h2><p id="""">My journey into this work didn't begin with policy papers or budget analyses. It began, as most authentic transformations do, in the messy intersection of personal experience and collective awakening. Years of youth work taught me that the young people society labels as ""problems"" are often our greatest teachers - mirrors reflecting back the systems that have failed them, the communities that have abandoned them, the adults who have forgotten what it means to see potential in the face of pain.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Our mountains are both institutional and internal - requiring courage, vulnerability, and an unwavering commitment to seeing beyond current limitations.</em></p><p id="""">This understanding eventually led me to create A Curious Tractor. Not because the world needed another consulting business, but because I kept encountering organisations, communities, and leaders who were asking the same fundamental question: <em id="""">How do we build something different when we're trapped inside systems designed for a world that no longer serves us?</em></p><p id="""">A Curious Tractor emerged from a simple recognition: that most of our approaches to change - whether in youth justice, organisational development, or community transformation - are still rooted in the same mechanistic thinking that created the problems we're trying to solve. We're trying to fix broken systems using the same logic that broke them in the first place.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">What if the path forward requires not just different strategies, but entirely different ways of thinking about change itself?</em></p><p id="""">The work we do through A Curious Tractor is about creating spaces for collaborative learning and development that honour the complexity of human systems. It's about working with organisations and communities to build capacity for transformation from the inside out. It's about recognising that sustainable change isn't something we do <em id="""">to</em> systems, it's something that emerges <em id="""">from</em> systems when we create the conditions for collective reimagining.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">We are not just participants, but architects of a new paradigm. Each conversation, each connection becomes a thread in a larger tapestry of collective reimagining.</em></p><p id="""">Every engagement, whether with a community organisation struggling to serve complex needs or a corporation trying to navigate rapid change, becomes an opportunity to practice what we preach: that transformation happens through relationship, that wisdom emerges from collective inquiry, that the solutions we need already exist within the communities experiencing the challenges.</p><h2 id="""">The Weight of Contradiction</h2><p id="""">But here's what keeps me awake at night: while we're working with organisations to embrace collaborative learning, vulnerability, and systemic thinking, the broader society seems to be moving in the opposite direction. While we're helping leaders understand that complex challenges require collective wisdom, our political systems are celebrating simplistic solutions to multifaceted problems.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">How do you maintain hope while watching a state spend $859,589 annually to warehouse each child in detention, knowing that the same money could transform thousands of young lives through the kind of collaborative, healing-centred approaches we know actually work?</em></p><p id="""">The mathematics are staggering in their moral clarity:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">$318+ million spent on a youth justice system with a 68% failure rate</li><li id="""">22-33 times higher detention rates for Indigenous children</li><li id="""">Youth crime representing only 13% of total crime while consuming disproportionate resources</li><li id="""">Community programs that work receiving table scraps while detention infrastructure gets hundreds of millions</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">But the numbers, devastating as they are, tell only part of the story.</em></p><p id="""">What breaks my heart is witnessing the cognitive dissonance between what we know works in human development and what we continue to fund in public policy. Every day through A Curious Tractor, we see organisations discovering that when you create conditions for authentic collaboration, when you honour the wisdom present in every community, when you design systems around human flourishing rather than control and compliance, remarkable transformations become possible.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Yet these same insights which seem obvious in organisational development contexts become radical impossibilities when applied to criminal justice, education, or social services.</em></p><h2 id="""">The Conversation We're Not Having</h2><p id="""">The public discourse around youth justice has become a carefully choreographed dance of moral posturing that avoids the questions that matter most:</p><p id=""""><em id="""">What kind of society do we want to be? What do we believe about human nature and the possibility for transformation?What are we actually protecting, and what are we actually destroying? How do we measure success in a system designed to heal rather than harm?</em></p><p id="""">Through A Curious Tractor's work, we've seen what happens when organisations are brave enough to engage these deeper questions. We've watched teams discover that their most entrenched conflicts contain the seeds of their greatest breakthroughs. We've facilitated processes where communities in crisis become laboratories for innovation. We've witnessed leaders learn that vulnerability isn't weakness it's the foundation of authentic authority.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">The most unsafe thing we can do is continue investing in approaches that create more trauma, more disconnection, more cycles of harm.</em></p><p id="""">But these lessons, which feel revolutionary in organisational contexts, are exactly what Indigenous communities have been practicing for thousands of years, what restorative justice practitioners have been demonstrating for decades, what countries like Portugal and Norway have been proving at scale for years.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">The question is not whether transformation is possible. The question is whether we have the courage to choose it.</em></p><h2 id="""">The Practice of Collective Transformation</h2><p id="""">Every engagement with A Curious Tractor becomes an experiment in applied hope. Spaces where power is shared rather than hoarded. Processes where wisdom emerges from collective inquiry rather than individual expertise. Approaches where healing and productivity aren't in competition but are recognized as interdependent.</p><p id="""">When we facilitate strategic planning processes that begin with personal reflection and end with collective commitment, we're practicing the integration of inner and outer transformation. When we design learning experiences that honour both individual growth and systemic change, we're modelling what becomes possible when we stop treating personal development and social justice as separate endeavors.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Every breakthrough begins with the audacity to imagine differently.</em></p><p id="""">But I'm tired of this work existing only in the margins, only in the spaces where people already believe transformation is possible. I'm frustrated that the insights emerging from collaborative learning processes aren't informing how we design criminal justice systems, education policies, or community response to crisis.</p><p id="""">This is why I've been quiet. Not because I've lost hope, but because I've been feeling the full weight of what we're choosing as individuals, as communities, as a society. <em id="""">In this moment of profound transition, we stand at the intersection of possibility and potential and we're choosing fear.</em></p><p id="""">I see a nation so privileged, so resourced, so capable of profound transformation, and we're being drawn into conversations that divide rather than unite, that diminish rather than expand, that close possibilities rather than open them. We're talking about protecting ""what's ours"" without examining what ownership means in a world where Indigenous children are detained at rates that can only be described as systematically genocidal.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">What are we actually hoarding when we hoard wealth, safety, opportunity? What are we actually protecting when we build walls instead of bridges? What are we actually achieving when winning arguments becomes more important than healing communities?</em></p><p id="""">The young people cycling through our justice system aren't abstractions to be managed or problems to be solved they are our children, carrying trauma we inflicted, responding to abandonment we created, reflecting back the violence we normalized. They are mirrors showing us exactly who we've chosen to become.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Our mountains are both institutional and internal requiring courage, vulnerability, and an unwavering commitment to seeing beyond current limitations.</em></p><p id="""">The transformation Queensland needs, that Australia needs, that our world desperately needs, cannot be achieved through policy reform alone. It requires what Indigenous communities have always known, what our best organisational development work confirms: that healing the systems requires healing ourselves, that changing the world requires changing our consciousness, that sustainable transformation emerges from the inside out.</p><p id="""">This is the heart of A Curious Tractor's approach: recognising that the quality of our external systems reflects the quality of our internal capacity for connection, collaboration, and care. That the way we treat the most vulnerable in our society mirrors the way we treat the most vulnerable parts of ourselves.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Money means fuck all if we don't have connections with people around us. Safety means nothing if it's built on other people's suffering. Being right is worthless if it comes at the cost of being human.</em></p><p id="""">The path forward requires us to become comfortable with not knowing, with being wrong, with having our assumptions challenged by people whose experiences we've never lived. It requires curiosity over certainty, questions over answers, vulnerability over defensiveness.</p><p id="""">What if we stopped trying to fix broken systems and started building new ones? What if we applied the same collaborative learning principles that transform organisations to transforming our approach to community safety? What if we measured success by how many young people we helped flourish rather than how many we managed to contain? What if we organised our communities around the principle that every person carries gifts the world desperately needs?</p><p id="""">This is not naive optimism - this is the same radical pragmatism that guides every A Curious Tractor engagement. The recognition that complex challenges require collective wisdom, that sustainable solutions emerge from authentic relationship, that transformation happens when we create conditions for it rather than trying to force it.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">The evidence is overwhelming that approaches rooted in healing, connection, and restoration create better outcomes for everyone involved.</em></p><p id="""">Portugal's health-focused drug policy. Norway's rehabilitation-centred prisons. Finland's collaborative education system. Boston's community policing model. These aren't utopian fantasies - they are practical demonstrations that different choices create different realities. They are large-scale applications of the same principles that make collaborative learning processes so transformative: starting with human dignity, honouring complexity, building from wisdom that already exists within communities.</p><p id="""">I'm here to think deeper about this. I'm going to say some real shit that people won't like. I'm here to push boundaries on what we accept as normal, as inevitable, as ""just the way things are.""</p><p id="""">Because if we're not challenged to think differently, if we're not curious about whether we might be wrong, if we're not always questioning our assumptions about human nature and social possibilities, then we're just reproducing the same patterns that got us here.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">This blog, this work, A Curious Tractor itself, it's all an invitation to anyone ready to move beyond the binary thinking that keeps us trapped in cycles of harm.</em></p><p id="""">It's for people willing to examine their own investments in punishment and control. It's for communities ready to experiment with healing-centred responses to conflict. It's for organisations brave enough to design systems around human flourishing rather than fear and compliance. It's for anyone who suspects that the way things are is not the way things have to be.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Together, we climb toward something that doesn't exist yet.</em></p><p id="""">Not because the path is clear, but because the destination is worthy. Not because we have all the answers, but because we're willing to live in the questions. Not because change is easy, but because the alternative - continuing to fund failure, to warehouse trauma, to systematically destroy the potential of our most vulnerable children is unacceptable.</p><h2 id="""">The Audacity of Love</h2><p id=""""><em id="""">Every breakthrough begins with the audacity to imagine differently.</em></p><p id="""">What I'm proposing through this work, through A Curious Tractor, through this writing, is not policy reform. What I'm proposing is a revolution in how we understand human nature, community safety, and our responsibility to each other. What I'm proposing is that we organise our society around the same radical assumptions that make collaborative learning so powerful: that every person carries wisdom, that collective intelligence emerges when we create conditions for it, that transformation is possible when we stop trying to force it and start creating space for it.</p><p id="""">This is the audacity of love: the willingness to see beyond current behaviour to human potential, to invest in possibilities rather than just manage problems, to build systems that call forth our highest rather than reinforce our lowest.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">In this moment of profound transition, we have a choice.</em></p><p id="""">We can continue pouring millions into the machinery of punishment while children sleep in police watch houses and Indigenous families are systematically destroyed. We can keep celebrating arrest statistics while ignoring the human cost of our collective failure to imagine better.</p><p id="""">Or we can choose the path that Portugal, Norway, and countless communities around the world have already mapped: the path from punishment to transformation, from fear to love, from systems that diminish to systems that dignify. The same path that guides every meaningful organisational transformation, every authentic leadership development process, every collaborative learning experience that actually changes how people see themselves and their possibilities.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">The choice is ours. The time is now. The future is unwritten.</em></p>","This is Part 1 of an ongoing series exploring the intersection of personal transformation and systemic change.

The installation is made up of works by a number of The Brio members, and includes drawings, paintings and cultural markings inscribed on reclaimed mining maps. There are also found signs that refer to land rights and mining. Included in this collection are works by Jimmy Frank Jupurrula and Joseph Williams Jungarayi, two cultural leaders in Tennant Creek. Beginning the exhibition with these works is a way to remind viewers of the importance of following cultural protocols as they enter the exhibition space. The symbols and shapes in the artworks reference these laws and sacred places on Country. The signs collected from Tennant Creek speak to the European laws and rules enforced upon those living in Tennant Creek and Indigenous communities. Here the artists have reclaimed and inverted these laws, maps and signs, for example by adding text: ‘Please clean up the mess you’ve…have finished messing up my Country. This is Aboriginal Land.’</em></strong></figcaption></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67326dbc67f6a5f3c90f5db6_673267e71cf62e5ad0e28f67_IMG_2657.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""><strong id="""">Jimmy in front of more of the exhibition pieces</strong></figcaption></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1333px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1333px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/672d29c58cd63e53617fed7c_672d263f0f81896eb63db71f_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-128.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""><strong id="""">Palm Island smoking ceremony in front of the Story Tree</strong></figcaption></figure><p id="""">As <a href=""https://www.wilyajanta.org/about"" id="""">Jimmy Frank Jupurrula</a> guided us through the exhibition, his stories brought each work to vivid life. Pausing before a large-scale canvas alive with bold marks and ancestral symbols, he shared how these works speak to both the ancient songlines of his country and the contemporary challenges facing his community. Hand-painted marks, created with discarded materials and industrial paint, tell stories of connection to country that stretch back countless generations while confronting present-day realities of life in Tennant Creek.</p><p id="""">""These aren't just paintings,"" Jimmy explained, gesturing to a particularly powerful piece. ""They're our way of showing you how we see our country, how we live with it, how we need to build with it."" His words carried the same energy that fuels his work with <a href=""https://www.wilyajanta.org/"" id="""">Wilya Janta</a> - a deep understanding that whether through art or architecture, the goal is to help people understand the profound connections between culture, country, and community. The materiality of his work - the use of found objects, industrial materials, and bold gestural marks - mirrors the Wilya Janta project's ambition to transform existing resources into something that serves community needs while honouring cultural protocols.</p><p id="""">As we moved through the space, Jimmy's stories wove together the temporal and the spiritual, the practical and the profound. His art, like the housing initiative he champions, carries the weight of tradition while boldly pushing into new territory. It's a powerful reminder that innovation in remote communities must be grounded in cultural understanding and proper protocols, whether we're discussing housing design or artistic practice.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67326dbc67f6a5f3c90f5d9d_6732694693a7a378f6d78c34_IMG_2697.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Jimmy in front of Kunari 2024 (which translates as lightening dreaming) represents an Indigenous mythical story, in which a ‘Black Zeus’ figure sends a storm as a consequence for breaking cultural protocol (taking water without permission).

Now transformed, the arm acts as a spear thrower, speaking both about customary Aboriginal law and Indigenous peoples’ strength and resilience despite the ongoing impacts of colonisation.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p id="""">What makes Wilya Janta's approach so revolutionary is how it challenges the status quo of remote housing. As Dr. Simon Quilty puts it, ""no medicines are going to fix this problem"" - the issue isn't just about building structures, it's about addressing systemic inequalities. This truth was reinforced during my visit to Palm Island's local store, where a simple bed frame and mattress cost nearly $1,000, with quality and durability issues compounded by the logistics of island life. These aren't just housing or furniture challenges - they're symptoms of deeper systemic issues that require community-led solutions.</p><p id="""">Standing in ACCA last night, watching the Tennant Creek Brio's ""audaciously punk attitude"" challenge conventional art world norms, I couldn't help but think of Uncle Alan Palm Island proudly showing us his hospital mural and the traditional canoe in the council boardroom - tangible symbols of connection, resilience, and the long history of cultural exchange. Like the Brio's art and Wilya Janta's housing vision, these artefacts speak to both ancient wisdom and future possibilities.</p><p id="""">Wilya Janta's pilot project embodies this understanding. Their approach isn't just about building houses - it's about building a new model of community empowerment. Every aspect, from the initial design concepts to ongoing maintenance, is guided by community input and cultural protocols. The incorporation of features like communal living spaces and outdoor kitchens reflects a deep understanding of how homes need to support cultural practices and family life.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1540px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1540px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67326dbc67f6a5f3c90f5dcd_67326c98e6d31635025702ae_Screenshot%25202024-11-12%2520at%25207.43.52%25E2%2580%25AFam.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Diane Stokes Nampin, outside the donga where she lives with her family on the edge of Tennant Creek.

It's about collective strength, about communities having the agency to shape their own solutions. The organisation's constitution, grounded in the story of Julawarra and Gilygi, demonstrates their commitment to honouring protocols while building bridges between Indigenous and non-Indigenous ways of working.</p><p id="""">What I witnessed at ACCA wasn't just an art exhibition or a fundraiser - it was a testament to what's possible when we truly support community-led change. Like watching the young rangers on Palm Island step confidently into teaching roles while sharing their knowledge of country, it demonstrated the power of enabling communities to write their own stories of regeneration and growth.</p><p id="""">Just as Uncle Alan Palm Island's mural at the Palm Island hospital depicts the ancient stories of sea country and trade routes - showing how his Elders' canoes navigated waters for thousands of years - the Wilya Janta pilot project charts a new course forward while honouring old ways. As the project advances, supported by philanthropic donations and potential government partnerships, it carries the potential to transform not just housing in Tennant Creek, but our entire approach to working with remote communities. In the council boardroom on Palm Island, Uncle Alan showed us the traditional canoe that his ancestors used for trade and connection - a physical reminder that innovation and tradition have always worked hand in hand in Aboriginal communities. Like that canoe, Wilya Janta's work is about creating vessels that carry both practical purpose and cultural meaning - spaces where cultural intelligence leads, where traditional knowledge guides innovation, and where every step forward strengthens the relationships that make lasting change possible. The stories in Uncle Alan's hospital mural and the traditional canoe in the boardroom remind us that the solutions we seek have deep roots in Aboriginal wisdom and ways of doing - we just need to listen, learn, and follow proper protocols in bringing them into the present.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67326fcd8406e969a40f91de_67326e84f8061975c4a5a08a_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-147.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""><strong id="""">Uncle Alan Palm Island's mural</strong></figcaption></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ea91d96ff3fda1ff23fc38/67326fcd8406e969a40f91e1_67326ed10f67c261e39e45fc_Palm%2520Island%2520-%2520Goods%2520Low%2520res-153.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">A&nbsp;traditional canoe in the Palm Island Council boardroom</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p id="""">This is the revolution that Wilya Janta are leading - one that challenges us to think differently about how we create change in remote Australia.
