# ACT Farm

**Home base where land care, learning, art-making, and community programs meet.**

ACT Farm is the studio practice—the operational heart where methodology becomes action. It's where we prototype, learn, fail, iterate, and prepare tools for handover.

---

## Purpose

The farm serves as:
- **Living laboratory** for regenerative innovation
- **Studio space** where land practice meets technology
- **Prototype ground** for tools and processes
- **Training base** for community capability building
- **Home** for the work that matters

---

## The Farm Metaphor

The farm metaphor is not branding. It shapes daily operations and enterprise choices:

| Farm Element | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Soil** | The knowledge network, community wisdom |
| **Seeds** | Projects, ideas, initiatives |
| **Tending** | Ongoing care and attention |
| **Harvest** | Impact, results, value returned |
| **Compost** | Learning from failure |
| **Seasons** | Natural rhythms and timing |

The system is the tractor, the humans are the farmers, the community is the harvest.

---

## 2026 Focus

1. **Run retreats, programs, workshops, and produce pathways** grounded in land practice
2. **Keep the farm metaphor visible** in daily operations and enterprise choices
3. **Link studio outputs** to land practice and community value
4. **Grow the capability** to hand over when ready

---

## Key Activities

### Retreats & Programs
- Strategic retreats for partners
- Community leadership programs
- Skills-building workshops
- Rest and renewal spaces

### Studio Innovation
- Prototype development
- Technical architecture
- Documentation and training materials
- Handover preparation

### Land Practice Integration
Every studio project should answer:
- How does this strengthen land practice?
- How does this advance responsible innovation?
- Who holds authority here, and how do we know?

---

## Farmhand & AI Strategy

Farmhand is ACT's AI layer—not a replacement for human judgment, but infrastructure that should:
- **Reduce admin** and hold context
- **Make it easier** to do the work that matters
- **Never override** community voice
- **Make listening easier** to hear

The Knowledge Hub is shared memory, not surveillance.

> Field note: Farmhand should never override community voice; it should make it easier to hear.

## How Studio and Land Connect

```
Land Practice (BCV, The Harvest)
         ↓
    Learnings
         ↓
Studio Innovation (ACT Farm)
         ↓
    Tools & Methods
         ↓
Community Partners
         ↓
    Feedback
         ↓
Back to Land Practice
```

This loop ensures:
- Technology serves land, not the reverse
- Innovation is grounded in real practice
- Community voice shapes tool development
- Handover readiness is built in

---

## Principles in Practice

### Tools Create Space
Infrastructure should be quiet. Reduce admin, hold context, make it easier to do the work that matters.

### Make With Lived Experience
Lived experience is not advisory; it is core capability. We build pathways for people under-skilled in formal systems but rich in lived knowledge.

### Enterprise Funds the Commons
Studio revenue funds land care, community wages, and long-term repair. Enterprise keeps the commons alive.

## LCAA in Practice

| Phase | Farm Application |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Listen** | Land practice observations, community feedback |
| **Curiosity** | Prototyping tools, testing methods |
| **Action** | Retreats, programs, workshops, produce pathways |
| **Art** | Making the farm metaphor visible in daily operations |

---

## Impact Evidence (ALMA Signals)

| Signal | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Evidence Strength** | Operational learning from programs and retreats |
| **Community Authority** | Studio serves community, not the reverse |
| **Harm Risk** | Low (facilitation and infrastructure) |
| **Implementation Capability** | High — core operational capacity |
| **Option Value** | Foundation for all other projects |
| **Community Value Return** | Tools, training, and capability building |

---

## Current Status

- Retreats and programs operating
- Studio innovation active
- Farm metaphor guiding operations
- Capability building for handover ongoing
