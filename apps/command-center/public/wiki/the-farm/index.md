# The Farm

> Land-based healing and cultural connection

## Philosophy

The Farm is a place of **healing through connection to land**. We believe that many of the challenges facing communities - trauma, disconnection, loss of identity - can be addressed through meaningful relationship with Country.

Colonial systems severed people from land. The Farm works to restore these connections by:

- Creating spaces for cultural practice on Country
- Supporting land-based healing programs
- Building intergenerational knowledge transfer
- Practicing regenerative land stewardship

## Healing Model

The Farm approaches healing through:

### Connection to Country
Time on land, learning to read and respond to the natural world. Understanding seasons, cycles, and the web of relationships that sustain life.

### Cultural Practice
Space for ceremony, story, and traditional practices. Elders sharing knowledge with young people. Reconnecting to cultural identity through doing.

### Productive Work
Meaningful labor that contributes to community wellbeing. Growing food, caring for animals, building structures. Work that matters.

### Community
Shared meals, shared work, shared stories. Building relationships through time spent together on Country.

## LCAA Framework

### Listen
Hearing what communities need from land-based programs. Understanding trauma histories and healing aspirations.

### Curiosity
Learning from Indigenous land management practices. Exploring how land connection supports mental health and cultural identity.

### Action
Creating land-based programs:
- Youth camps and cultural immersion
- Elder knowledge-sharing programs
- Regenerative land management training
- Healing retreats and ceremonies

### Art
Documenting and sharing the stories of healing that happen on Country. Showing what's possible when people reconnect with land.
