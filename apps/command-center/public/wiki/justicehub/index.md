> Transforming youth justice through community-led solutions

## Philosophy

JusticeHub exists to transform how communities and systems respond to young people. We believe that **those closest to the problem are closest to the solution**.

The justice system often fails young people by treating symptoms rather than addressing root causes. JusticeHub partners with communities to co-design justice responses that:

- Center the voices of young people and their families
- Address the underlying factors that lead to justice system contact
- Build pathways forward rather than cycles of punishment
- Respect cultural protocols and community wisdom

## LCAA Framework

### Listen
Deep listening with young people, families, and communities affected by the justice system. Understanding lived experience before proposing solutions.

### Curiosity
Exploring what authentic community-led justice looks like. Learning from Indigenous justice practices, international models like Diagrama, and local community wisdom.

### Action
Building platforms and programs that center community voice:
- Quandamooka Justice Strategy
- Youth Voice programs across Queensland
- Community-led diversion programs
- Diagrama partnership (Spain)

### Art
Storytelling that shifts narratives around youth and justice. Amplifying the voices of young people to challenge deficit-based thinking.
