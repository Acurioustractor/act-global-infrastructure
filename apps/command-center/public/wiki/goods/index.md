# Goods on Country

> Economic empowerment through community-owned enterprise

## Philosophy

Goods creates pathways for community economic sovereignty. We believe **communities should own the means to build wealth**, not just participate in external economies.

The extractive economy takes resources, labor, and value from communities. Goods inverts this by:

- Supporting community-owned enterprises
- Building supply chains that keep value local
- Celebrating the story and provenance of community-made goods
- Creating markets that respect cultural protocols

### Premium Quality + Social Impact

We lead with quality, not charity. Every product demonstrates that:
- Community-made can mean premium quality
- Social impact enhances rather than diminishes value
- Fair wages and sustainable practices are non-negotiable
