# Goods

> Economic empowerment through community-owned enterprise

## Philosophy

Goods creates pathways for community economic sovereignty. We believe **communities should own the means to build wealth**, not just participate in external economies.

The extractive economy takes resources, labor, and value from communities. Goods inverts this by:

- Supporting community-owned enterprises
- Building supply chains that keep value local
- Celebrating the story and provenance of community-made goods
- Creating markets that respect cultural protocols

## LCAA Framework

### Listen
Understanding community economic aspirations and barriers. What do communities want to build? What's standing in their way?

### Curiosity
Exploring models of community ownership and wealth building. Learning from Indigenous economic practices and cooperative models.

### Action
Creating platforms for community enterprise and exchange:
- Marketplace for community-made products
- Supply chain tracking and provenance
- Direct producer-to-consumer connections
- Enterprise development support

### Art
Celebrating the story behind every product. Every item carries the story of its maker, their community, and their country.

## Enterprise Model

Goods supports three types of community enterprise:

1. **Producer Enterprises** - Individual makers and small producers
2. **Community Enterprises** - Cooperatives and community-owned businesses
3. **Social Enterprises** - Mission-driven businesses with community benefit

## Provenance & Story

Every product on Goods carries:
- **Maker story** - Who made this and why
- **Community connection** - Where value flows
- **Country acknowledgment** - Whose land this comes from
- **Impact metrics** - What difference your purchase makes
