# Storytelling, Data Sovereignty, and Community Recovery

> Storytelling and data sovereignty anchor recovery work, with Elders guiding what is shared and why.

---

## Context

**Place:** Palm Island community
**Voice Owner:** Community storytellers and Elders group (consented)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — Elders review required for external use

---

## Story Summary

In the aftermath of devastating storms, Palm Island community faced not just physical recovery but the challenge of telling their own story. Previous disaster responses had seen external media and researchers arrive, extract stories, and leave — sometimes misrepresenting the community or exposing sensitive information.

Through Empathy Ledger, the community established a different model. Elders guide what is shared and why. Storytellers maintain control over their narratives. Data sovereignty means the community owns their recovery story.

The result: recovery documentation that serves the community first, respects cultural protocols, and provides evidence for future planning — on the community's terms.

| **Community Value Return** | High | Community owns the narrative |
