# Young Person Returns to School After Cultural Healing

> After on-Country healing, a young person returns to school, mentors others, and names teaching as a future path.

---

## Context

**Place:** Central Australia (on-Country program)
**Voice Owner:** Youth participant with community support (identity protected)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — identity protected

---

## Story Summary

A young person who had disengaged from school found their way back through Oonchiumpa's on-Country healing program. Time on Country, connection with Elders, and cultural learning created the foundation for re-engagement.

But the story doesn't end with school return. This young person began mentoring others who were struggling. They named teaching as their future path — becoming someone who helps others find their way, just as they were helped.

This is the LCAA loop in practice: listening led to curiosity about what healing looks like, action through the program, and art when the young person's transformation becomes a model for others.
