# Elders Speak: "We Should Have Been Consulted"

> Elders describe storm impacts and the need for decision-making that includes Elders from the start.

---

## Context

**Place:** Palm Island Elders group
**Voice Owner:** Elders collective authority
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — Elders review required for external use

---

## Story Summary

After major storms impacted Palm Island, Elders spoke clearly: emergency response and recovery planning had proceeded without meaningful consultation. Decisions affecting the whole community were made by external agencies without understanding local knowledge, cultural considerations, or community priorities.

The Elders' message was simple but powerful: "We should have been consulted." This isn't about bureaucratic process — it's about respect, effectiveness, and the recognition that Elders hold crucial knowledge about their community.

The response: embedding Elder consultation into planning processes, not as an afterthought but as a starting point. This vignette documents the shift from excluded to included.
