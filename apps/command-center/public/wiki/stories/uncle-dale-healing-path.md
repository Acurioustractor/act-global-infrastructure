# Building a Healing Path: Uncle Dale's Vision for Youth Justice Reform

> A vision for cultural healing centres that transform youth justice through Country, culture, and care.

---

## Context

**Place:** Traditional Owner-led vision for cultural healing centres
**Voice Owner:** Traditional Owner and community leader (Uncle Dale)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — Traditional Owner review required

---

## Story Summary

Uncle Dale's vision for youth justice reform doesn't start with detention facilities or court processes. It starts with Country, culture, and care.

His vision: cultural healing centres where young people in the justice system can reconnect with identity, learn from Elders, and find pathways forward that don't require incarceration. These aren't programs bolted onto the existing system — they're alternatives that address root causes.

Key elements of the vision:
- **On-Country healing** — Connection to land as foundation
- **Elder guidance** — Cultural authority central to process
- **Identity restoration** — Understanding who you are and where you come from
- **Community accountability** — Answering to community, not just courts

This vision shapes JusticeHub's direction: documenting and connecting community-led alternatives, not just reforming existing systems.
