# Story Vignettes

We weave story vignettes and community voice through this compendium. Each vignette comes from Empathy Ledger with explicit consent and a clear usage scope. The goal is to foreground lived experience and authority, not decorate the work.

## Consent Scopes

|-------|---------|-----------|
| **INTERNAL ONLY** | Working notes, sensitive detail, identity at risk | Team only |
| **EXTERNAL-LITE** | System-level learnings, identity protected | With care |
| **EXTERNAL** | Explicit consent, cultural review complete | Public |
