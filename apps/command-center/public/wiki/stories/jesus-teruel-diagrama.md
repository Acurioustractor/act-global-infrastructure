# Jesús Teruel — Diagrama Key Story

> A respect-centred approach to youth rehabilitation and reintegration that offers a live reference for humane justice practice.

---

## Context

**Place:** Murcia, Spain (Diagrama Foundation)
**Voice Owner:** Diagrama practice leader
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE

---

## Story Summary

Jesús Teruel's work with the Diagrama Foundation in Spain offers something rare: a live, operating example of youth justice done differently. While Australian conversations about youth justice often get stuck between punishment and permissiveness, Diagrama demonstrates a third way.

The approach centres on respect — for young people, for their potential, for their complexity. Key principles:
- Young people are treated as capable of change
- Relationships with staff are primary tools
- Environment matters — design for dignity
- Integration into community is the goal from day one
- Measurement focuses on wellbeing, not just compliance

ACT's learning journey to Diagrama wasn't about importing a model. It was about seeing proof that alternatives work, and bringing that evidence into Australian conversations.
