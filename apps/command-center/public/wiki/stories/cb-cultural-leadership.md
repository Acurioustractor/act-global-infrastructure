# CB: Understanding Cultural Responsibility and Leadership

> A young man embraces cultural responsibility and leadership, showing remorse and growth.

---

## Context

**Place:** Central Australia
**Voice Owner:** Young person with cultural mentors (identity protected)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — identity protected

---

## Story Summary

CB's journey through Oonchiumpa's program demonstrates something often missing in mainstream justice responses: the development of genuine cultural responsibility.

Through connection with cultural mentors and Elders, CB began to understand:
- **Who he is** — Identity grounded in culture and Country
- **What he carries** — Responsibilities to family and community
- **What he's done** — Honest reflection leading to genuine remorse
- **Where he's headed** — Leadership potential recognized and nurtured

The remorse isn't performed compliance. It emerges from understanding — when young people know who they are and what they represent, they care about the impact of their actions.

CB is now seen as a young leader, someone who might guide others through similar journeys.
