# Community Innovation: Beds, Washing Machines, and Orange Sky

> Community-led prototyping of beds and washing machines links local needs to practical manufacturing pathways.

---

## Context

**Place:** Palm Island
**Voice Owner:** Community makers and service teams
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — review for commercial details

---

## Story Summary

When storms destroyed homes and possessions on Palm Island, the gap between need and supply became stark. Beds, washing machines, fridges — essentials for health and dignity — were either unavailable or would arrive months later, often unsuitable for local conditions.

Community members and ACT began prototyping solutions: beds designed for transport to remote communities, washing machines that could be maintained locally, supply chains that kept value in community.

The connection with Orange Sky (mobile laundry services) revealed a pattern: communities don't lack capability, they lack access to appropriate tools and support infrastructure. Manufacturing for community becomes manufacturing *with* community.

## LCAA Shift

**From:** Curiosity (what do communities actually need?)
**To:** Action (prototype to production pathway)
**What changed:** Essential goods became a community enterprise, not external charity
