# Community Recognition and External Referral Requests

> Oonchiumpa received 10 external referrals, showing trust, demand, and the need for community-led pathways.

---

## Context

**Place:** Central Australia
**Voice Owner:** Community-level signal (program and partners)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE

---

## Story Summary

One of the clearest signals of a program's value is when other services start referring to it. Oonchiumpa received 10 external referrals — agencies recognizing that community-led, culturally-grounded support achieves what mainstream services struggle to.

These referrals represent:
- **Trust** — Other services confident in Oonchiumpa's approach
- **Demand** — Unmet need for community-led alternatives
- **Recognition** — Effectiveness visible to partners
- **Gap filling** — Services that mainstream can't provide

The referrals also reveal a challenge: demand exceeds capacity. This vignette documents both the success signal and the need for sustainable growth.
