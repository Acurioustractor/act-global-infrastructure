# The Origin of A Curious Tractor

> The founding philosophy that technology should cultivate community growth, not extract value.

## Context

**Place:** ACT origin story across youth justice and platform work
**Voice Owner:** Founding team and community collaborators

## Story Summary

A Curious Tractor began with a simple observation: most technology extracts value from communities. Data flows out, insights flow out, decisions are made elsewhere. Communities become the subject of technology, not the owners of it.

The tractor metaphor came from agricultural machinery: a tractor's Power Take-Off (PTO) transfers engine power to implements. The tractor doesn't do the work itself — it enables other tools to work. And crucially, implements can be unhitched, repaired locally, and used without the tractor.

This became ACT's design principle: build technology that transfers power to communities, can be owned and modified locally, and is designed for eventual obsolescence. Youth Justice work and the Empathy Ledger platform both emerged from this philosophy.

The question isn't "what can we build?" but "what can communities own when we're gone?"
