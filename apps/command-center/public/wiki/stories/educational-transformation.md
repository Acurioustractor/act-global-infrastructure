# Educational Transformation: 72% Return to School

> Most disengaged participants returned to school or alternative pathways through sustained support and cultural mentorship.

---

## Context

**Place:** Central Australia
**Voice Owner:** Community program team and young people
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE

---

## Story Summary

The number speaks clearly: 72% of disengaged young people supported by Oonchiumpa returned to school or alternative educational pathways.

This isn't about forcing compliance. The pathway works because:
- **Cultural mentorship** — Relationships that matter before education
- **Sustained support** — Not short-term programs, but persistent presence
- **Alternative pathways** — Not just mainstream school, but education that fits
- **Family involvement** — Working with whole families, not just individuals

The 72% represents individual stories of reconnection. Each percentage point is someone who found their way back to learning — not because they were pressured, but because someone walked alongside them until education made sense again.
