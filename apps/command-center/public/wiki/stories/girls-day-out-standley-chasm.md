# Girls Day Out: Cultural Empowerment at Standley Chasm

> A day on Country with Traditional Owners builds confidence, cultural authority, and the belief that young women can lead.

---

## Context

**Place:** Standley Chasm (on-Country visit with Traditional Owners)
**Voice Owner:** Young people and cultural mentors
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE

---

## Story Summary

A group of young women visited Standley Chasm with Traditional Owners and cultural mentors through Oonchiumpa. What might look like a simple outing was actually something deeper: a day of cultural empowerment.

On Country, with Elders who welcomed them:
- Young women learned about place and story
- They were told they could be leaders
- They practiced cultural protocol
- They experienced belonging

The confidence built on days like this carries forward. Young women who might have doubted their place in leadership conversations began to see themselves differently.
