# School Partnership Success Stories

> Schools request Oonchiumpa support and report stronger student engagement through cultural mentorship.

---

## Context

**Place:** Central Australia
**Voice Owner:** Educators and cultural mentors
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE

---

## Story Summary

Schools in Central Australia increasingly recognize that student engagement requires more than curriculum and classroom management. They're actively requesting Oonchiumpa support — cultural mentors who can connect with students in ways that mainstream education often can't.

The results are visible:
- Students who had disengaged are returning
- Attendance improving in partner schools
- Teachers reporting students more settled
- Cultural mentors building relationships that persist beyond school hours

The partnership model doesn't replace education — it supplements it with cultural grounding that makes education possible. Schools that once struggled to reach certain students now have pathways through cultural connection.
