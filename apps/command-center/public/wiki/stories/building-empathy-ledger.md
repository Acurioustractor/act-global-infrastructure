# Building Empathy Ledger: A Journey of Connection

> Why Empathy Ledger exists and how consent, cultural protocols, and data sovereignty shape the platform.

---

## Context

**Place:** Platform-wide, serving multiple communities
**Voice Owner:** Platform founder and community collaborators (consented internal)
**Consent Status:** INTERNAL ONLY — review required for external use

---

## Story Summary

Empathy Ledger began with a question: how do we create infrastructure for storytelling that respects community sovereignty? The platform was built through deep listening with communities who had experienced extractive research and media practices.

The design centres on:
- **Consent at every level** — Who can see, who can share, who can use
- **Cultural protocols** — Elder review, sacred content protection, ongoing consent
- **Data sovereignty** — Communities own their data, can export anytime
- **40% value return** — If stories generate value, communities share in it

Every feature reflects what communities told us they needed: control, visibility, and the ability to change their minds.
