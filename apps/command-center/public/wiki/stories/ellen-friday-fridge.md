# Ellen Friday: Still Waiting for a Fridge

> A damaged fridge after the storm highlights the health and dignity cost of broken essentials.

## Context

**Place:** Palm Island
**Voice Owner:** Community member (identity protected)
**Consent Status:** INTERNAL ONLY — remove personal details before external use

## Story Summary

After the storm, Ellen's fridge was destroyed. Not just inconvenienced — destroyed. Months later, she was still waiting for a replacement. Without reliable refrigeration, food safety becomes impossible, medication storage becomes uncertain, and daily life becomes a series of workarounds.

This isn't one person's problem. Across remote communities, broken essential appliances represent a cascade of health and dignity impacts. A damaged fridge means:
- Food spoilage and waste
- Unable to store medication safely
- Increased costs from frequent small purchases
- Loss of dignity in hosting visitors

Ellen's story became a catalyst for Goods on Country's fridge pathway — designing appliances that can be maintained locally and replaced quickly.
