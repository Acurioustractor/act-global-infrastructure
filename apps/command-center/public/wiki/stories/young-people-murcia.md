# Young People Murcia — Key Story

> Young people describe the detention environment, offering clear insight into what needs to change.

---

## Context

**Place:** Murcia, Spain
**Voice Owner:** Young people in Diagrama programs (identity protected)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — identity protected

---

## Story Summary

During ACT's learning journey to Diagrama in Spain, young people in the youth justice system shared their experiences directly. Their insights cut through policy debates to reveal what actually matters:

**What helps:**
- Being treated with respect, not suspicion
- Staff who see potential, not just problems
- Having responsibility, not just restrictions
- Connection to education and skills
- Clear pathways back to community

**What harms:**
- Environments designed around control, not care
- Staff who keep distance
- No clear future after release
- Isolation from family and community
- Being defined by worst moments

These aren't policy recommendations — they're lived experience. They inform JusticeHub's approach to documenting what alternatives need to include.
