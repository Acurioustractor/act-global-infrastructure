# Atnarpa Homestead Cultural Exchange - Girls Trip

> Young Luritja girls learn cultural tourism and land management while being welcomed onto Country.

---

## Context

**Place:** Atnarpa (Loves Creek Station)
**Voice Owner:** Young women with cultural mentors
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE

---

## Story Summary

Young Luritja women visited Atnarpa Station through Oonchiumpa's cultural exchange program. They were welcomed onto Country by the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family who are developing cultural tourism there.

The experience combined:
- **Welcome to Country** — Protocol and respect across cultural boundaries
- **Cultural tourism learning** — Seeing what a community-owned tourism enterprise looks like
- **Land management** — Understanding the work of caring for Country
- **Future visioning** — Young women seeing pathways they might pursue

This wasn't a one-way visit. The exchange built relationships across communities, shared knowledge in both directions, and planted seeds for future collaboration.
