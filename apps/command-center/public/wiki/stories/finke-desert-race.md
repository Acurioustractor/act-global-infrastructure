## Story Summary

The Finke Desert Race is one of Australia's iconic off-road races, running from Alice Springs to Finke. For young men in Oonchiumpa's program, attending the race became more than spectating — it became an on-Country experience.

Camping along the route, connecting with the event's energy, and being part of something bigger than themselves:
- **Place connection** — Learning the Country between Alice and Finke
- **Community pride** — Being part of a major community event
- **Cultural context** — Understanding the land the race crosses
- **Positive identity** — Belonging to something exciting and legitimate

The race created a hook for deeper learning — an event young men wanted to attend that became a vehicle for cultural connection.
