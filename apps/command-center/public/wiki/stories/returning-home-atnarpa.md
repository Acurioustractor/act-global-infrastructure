# Returning Home to Atnarpa: The Bloomfield Family's Journey

> Reclaiming country and restoring the homestead becomes a foundation for cultural tourism and intergenerational knowledge.

---

## Context

**Place:** Atnarpa (Loves Creek Station)
**Voice Owner:** Bloomfield/Wiltshire family (Traditional Owners)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — community approval required for external use

---

## Story Summary

The Bloomfield and Wiltshire families' journey to reclaim Loves Creek Station — Atnarpa — represents something larger than property rights. It's the restoration of connection between people and Country, and the creation of a foundation for intergenerational knowledge transfer.

The homestead restoration isn't just about buildings. It's about creating a place where:
- Young people can learn on Country from Elders
- Cultural tourism can generate sustainable income
- Traditional knowledge can be practiced and passed on
- Healing can happen through connection to land

Atnarpa has become a key site for Oonchiumpa programs, hosting boys' and girls' trips that connect young people to culture, land, and future possibilities.
