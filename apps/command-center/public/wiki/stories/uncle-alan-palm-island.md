# Uncle Alan Palm Island — Key Story

> A short recorded exchange that carries craft knowledge and continuity.

---

## Context

**Place:** Palm Island
**Voice Owner:** Elder and artist (Uncle Alan)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — confirm cultural review for external use

---

## Story Summary

Uncle Alan's story captures something precious: the transmission of craft knowledge from Elder to learner. In a short recorded exchange, decades of practice and cultural continuity are visible.

This isn't about preserving static tradition. It's about:
- Living knowledge passed through relationship
- Craft as cultural expression
- The role of Elders in maintaining continuity
- Art as evidence of cultural vitality

The recording preserves not just what Uncle Alan knows, but how he teaches — the patience, the connection, the generosity of sharing.
