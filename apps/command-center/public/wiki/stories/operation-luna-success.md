# Operation Luna Success: Dramatic Reduction in Youth Offending

> A community-led response contributed to a major reduction in youth offending and case management burden.

---

## Context

**Place:** Central Australia
**Voice Owner:** Community program team and partners
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE

---

## Story Summary

Operation Luna was a community-led response to youth offending in Central Australia. The results were dramatic: significant reductions in youth offending and case management burden.

What made it work:
- **Community-led** — Not imposed from outside, but designed with community
- **Coordinated response** — Multiple services working together, not fragmented
- **Cultural foundation** — Grounded in community authority and cultural practice
- **Sustained engagement** — Not short-term crisis response, but persistent presence

The reduction in offending also reduced the burden on case workers, police, and courts — freeing resources for prevention rather than reaction.
