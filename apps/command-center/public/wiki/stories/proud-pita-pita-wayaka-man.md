# Proud Pita Pita Wayaka Man: My Roots

> A story of heritage, identity, and mentorship that grounds youth wellbeing in cultural authority.

---

## Context

**Place:** Mount Isa, QLD
**Voice Owner:** Community leader (identity can be protected if needed)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE

---

## Story Summary

In Mount Isa, the BG Fit program connects youth wellbeing with cultural identity. This vignette captures a community leader's story — a proud Pita Pita Wayaka man whose roots are the foundation for the mentorship he provides.

His story isn't about a "journey" from somewhere bad to somewhere good. It's about:
- Knowing who you are and where you come from
- Drawing strength from heritage
- Passing that strength to the next generation
- Leadership grounded in cultural authority

When young people see someone proud of their identity, it opens permission to explore their own. Cultural mentorship isn't a program add-on — it's the core that makes other programs work.
