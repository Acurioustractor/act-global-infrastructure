# Peggy Palm Island's Story

> A personal story preserved in the storyteller's own voice, strengthening local memory and archive.

---

## Context

**Place:** Palm Island
**Voice Owner:** Community storyteller (Peggy)
**Consent Status:** EXTERNAL-LITE — confirm cultural review for external use

---

## Story Summary

Peggy's story is preserved through the PICC Photo Kiosk project — a community-owned archive initiative on Palm Island. Her story is told in her own voice, without external editing or framing.

This matters because:
- Community stories often get filtered through external media
- Local archives preserve community-controlled history
- The storyteller's voice remains primary
- Future generations can hear directly from Elders

The Photo Kiosk project creates infrastructure for this kind of preservation — technology that serves community memory rather than extracting it.
