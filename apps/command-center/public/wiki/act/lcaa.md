# LCAA: Listen, Curiosity, Action, Art

LCAA is our operating rhythm. It is not a marketing frame. It is how we choose, build, and learn. Think of it as a story arc we return to.

---

## The Four Phases

### Listen

**Start with place, people, history, and community voice. We do not assume. We ask.**

- Begin with what already exists
- Understand context, relationships, and history before proposing
- Deep, patient, humble listening
- Community voices set the agenda

**In Practice:**
- Community conversations before product decisions
- Elder consultation on cultural matters
- Understanding local capacity and readiness

---

### Curiosity

**Ask better questions, prototype, test, and learn together.**

- Stay curious about assumptions
- Explore alternatives
- Learn from failure
- The best solutions often come from unexpected places

**In Practice:**
- Low-cost prototypes before full builds
- Testing with community, not for community
- Embracing "we don't know yet"

---

### Action

**Build with partners and deliver tangible outcomes that can be owned locally.**

- Move from understanding to delivery
- Build, prototype, iterate
- Small experiments that inform larger change
- Tangible outputs communities can hold

**In Practice:**
- Deliverables designed for handover
- Documentation as a core output
- Training embedded in delivery

---

### Art

**Translate change into culture, meaning, and story.**

- Art reaches places data cannot
- Express through story, image, sound, performance
- Art moves people to action
- Make change felt and understood

**In Practice:**
- Residencies, exhibitions, and installations
- Story as primary evidence
- Art woven throughout, not added at the end

---

## The Loop

```
      Listen
         ↓
    Curiosity
         ↓
      Action
         ↓
        Art
         ↓
     (back to Listen)
```

**LCAA loops. Art returns us to Listen.**

The loop only completes when Art returns us to Listen. Residencies, exhibitions, and installations are not endpoints—they are invitations back into practice.

---

## LCAA in Practice

### Project Planning

Every project should be located within LCAA:
- Where are we in the loop?
- What phase needs attention?
- Are we rushing past Listen?

### Decision Making

When unclear, return to LCAA:
- Have we really listened?
- Are we curious or certain?
- Is action premature?
- Where's the art?

### Reporting

Tag work by LCAA phase:
- **Listen phase** outputs: conversations, research, relationships
- **Curiosity phase** outputs: prototypes, experiments, learnings
- **Action phase** outputs: deliverables, tools, infrastructure
- **Art phase** outputs: stories, exhibitions, cultural moments

## LCAA and Other Frameworks

| Framework | Relationship to LCAA |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **ALMA** | Evidence model that feeds all phases |
| **Empathy Ledger** | Core tool for capturing Listen and Art |
| **Principles** | Guardrails for how we move through LCAA |
| **Consent** | Non-negotiable at every phase |

## Field Notes

> "LCAA is not a checklist. It's a practice. Some projects need years in Listen. Others move quickly to Action. The discipline is staying present to where you actually are."

> "If we're building without listening, we're building the wrong thing. If we're acting without curiosity, we're moving too fast."

> "Art is how we know we've learned something. If we can't express it, we haven't integrated it."
