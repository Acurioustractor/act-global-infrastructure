# A Curious Tractor (ACT)

> Technology and storytelling for community transformation

## Mission

ACT exists to support communities to tell their own stories, build their own systems, and drive their own transformation.

We are not a service provider. We are a **partner and enabler** - building tools, platforms, and capabilities that communities can own and evolve themselves.

## Philosophy

### Stories are Data
Quantitative metrics often miss what matters most. We believe lived experience, captured through stories, is the most powerful form of impact evidence.

### Community Sovereignty
Communities should control their own narratives, their own data, and their own futures. We build technology that enables sovereignty, not dependency.

### Regenerative Practice
Everything we do should leave systems better than we found them. We work to heal, not extract.

### Systems Change
Individual programs aren't enough. We work at the systems level - changing policies, practices, and power dynamics.

### Beautiful Obsolescence

Our ultimate success metric: Communities saying:
> "ACT? We don't need them anymore. We run this ourselves now."

We're not building dependency. We're building community power through:
- Superior tools designed for community ownership
- Authentic partnerships that transfer capability
- Systems designed for independence, not lock-in
- Platform forking capabilities
- Complete data export tools

## LCAA Framework

LCAA is our methodology for community engagement:

### Listen
Start by listening. Deep, patient, humble listening. Understanding context, history, relationships, and aspirations before proposing solutions.

### Curiosity
Stay curious. Question assumptions, explore alternatives, learn from failure. The best solutions often come from unexpected places.

### Action
Move from understanding to action. Build, prototype, iterate. Small experiments that inform larger change.

### Art
Express through story, image, sound, performance. Art reaches places that data cannot. Art moves people to action.

## ALMA Framework

ALMA (Active Listening, Measuring, Amplifying) is our approach to impact measurement:

- **Active Listening** - Creating conditions for authentic storytelling
- **Measuring** - Connecting stories to outcomes
- **Amplifying** - Sharing stories to drive change

## The Ecosystem

## Cultural Safety Principles

### OCAP (Indigenous Data Sovereignty)
- **Ownership** - Communities own their collective data
- **Control** - Communities control access and use
- **Access** - Communities can access their own data anytime
- **Possession** - Data stays under community custody

### Implementation
- Elder Review Systems for sacred content
- Ongoing Consent with renewable expiry
- Cultural Protocols customizable per organization
- AI analysis only with explicit opt-in

## Impact Metrics

- **240** storytellers connected (Empathy Ledger)
- **8** remote communities served
- **6** integrated platforms
- **131** custom components (Empathy Ledger)
