# A Curious Tractor (ACT)

> A regenerative innovation studio stewarding a working farm on Jinibara Country.

---

## Identity and Intent

ACT exists to grow co-stewardship and shared governance through land, story, and action. The studio is the toolkit communities can hold, shape, and outgrow. We work to dismantle extractive systems through ethical technology, Indigenous data sovereignty, and community-centred design.

This compendium anchors decisions in **LCAA** (Listen, Curiosity, Action and Art) and balances land practice with innovation, enterprise, and product work so we speak with one voice across projects. **ALMA** (Authentic Learning for Meaningful Accountability) is the core impact and learning model; **Empathy Ledger** is the core impact tool.

### A Practice Book, Not a Report

This compendium is a field guide, written to be used: on Country, in the studio, in meetings, and in the quiet hours where decisions are made. It will never be finished. We add stories, prototypes, drawings, and learnings as we go. A good page helps someone act with care.

### The ACT Way: Make Space

> "The best systems are invisible. They create space for humans to be human."

We build tractors and toolkits, not empires. Infrastructure should disappear into the work, make listening easier, keep consent visible, and leave more time for people to gather, make, and lead.

### Identity Before Product

We start with identity and belonging, then build the thing. Events are culture, not marketing. Communities are owners, not audiences.

## How to Use This Compendium

- Align project plans, product choices, and communications with LCAA
- Keep land practice and cultural sovereignty central as enterprise grows
- Coordinate across projects without flattening their identities
- Keep claims honest and grounded in lived practice
- Use it as a living record: add stories, shifts, and open questions as they arise

## 2026 Focus Areas

This year is about balance: land stewardship, studio innovation, and enterprise maturity moving in step.

1. **Land stewardship with shared governance** — Keep conservation-first practice, prepare co-stewardship groundwork
2. **Innovation studio and product work** — Build tools that serve community ownership, not dependence
3. **The Harvest as grounded enterprise** — Support local makers and micro-enterprise in Witta
4. **Goods on Country manufacturing** — Move from pilots to reliable production
5. **Story and evidence** — Treat storytelling as infrastructure for change, not marketing

> Field note: Pace is a form of ethics. We move at the speed of trust, maintenance, and land capacity.
