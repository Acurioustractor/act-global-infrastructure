# Governance & Consent

Consent is not a compliance box; it is part of the work and the product. Community authority is the default, not the exception.

---

## Core Commitments

| Commitment | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Consent is explicit** | No assumed permissions |
| **Consent is ongoing** | Renewable, not permanent |
| **Consent is revocable** | Withdrawal respected immediately |
| **Elder review required** | Where cultural protocols demand it |
| **Sacred knowledge protected** | Hard blocks, not warnings |
| **Partner nuance internal** | Sensitive detail stays private until reviewed |

---

## OCAP: Indigenous Data Sovereignty

We implement OCAP principles in code and practice:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Ownership** | Communities own their collective data |
| **Control** | Communities control access and use decisions |
| **Access** | Communities can access their own data anytime |
| **Possession** | Data stays under community custody |

### In Practice

- Elder Review Systems for sacred content
- Ongoing Consent with renewable expiry (6-12 months)
- Cultural Protocols customizable per organization
- AI analysis only with explicit opt-in
- Full data export available anytime

## Shareability Matrix

| Level | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **INTERNAL ONLY** | Working notes, partner nuance, sensitive detail | Draft documents, partner negotiations, personal details |
| **EXTERNAL-LITE** | System-level learnings without identifiers | Anonymized patterns, general insights, methodology |
| **EXTERNAL** | Explicit consent, cultural review, safe-to-share | Published stories, case studies, public reports |

### Before Sharing Externally

Ask:
- Is consent explicit and current?
- Has cultural review happened where required?
- Are identifiers removed or approved?
- Is the purpose clear and appropriate?
- Who benefits from this sharing?

---

## Community Authority

**Community authority carries the highest weight, even when it complicates delivery.**

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Elder says wait | We wait |
| Partner wants speed over safety | We slow down |
| Community questions approach | We revisit |
| Cultural protocol unclear | We ask, not assume |

## Consent Architecture in Empathy Ledger

### Five-Tier Permission Levels

1. **Sacred** — Hard-blocked, Elder review required
2. **Restricted** — Named individuals only
3. **Community Only** — Organization members
4. **Educational** — Approved educational use
5. **Public** — Open sharing with attribution

### Consent Records

Every story tracks:
- Consent scope (what can be shared)
- Consent giver (who approved)
- Consent date (when approved)
- Renewal date (when to check again)
- Cultural sensitivity level
- Revocation history

---

## Elder Review Workflow

When cultural protocols require Elder review:

1. **Flag** — Content marked for review
2. **Queue** — Added to Elder review queue
3. **Review** — Elder examines content
4. **Decision** — Approve / Restrict / Request changes
5. **Record** — Decision documented
6. **Apply** — Permissions updated

Elder decisions are final on cultural matters.

## AI and Consent

AI analysis requires explicit opt-in:

| Setting | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **No AI** | No automated analysis of content |
| **Internal AI Only** | ACT tools only, no external services |
| **AI Permitted** | Includes external AI services |

Default is **No AI**. Consent must be explicit.

---

## Partner Protocols

### With Partners

- Governance agreements before data sharing
- Clear boundaries on use
- Mutual accountability
- Regular review cycles

### Partner-Specific Nuance

- Marked `[INTERNAL ONLY]` in documents
- Not shared without partner review
- Respected in all communications
- Deleted on request

---

## Consent as Relationship

> Field note: Consent is a relationship, not a checkbox. We keep listening after we share.

Consent isn't a gate we pass through once. It's an ongoing conversation:

- Check in regularly
- Notice discomfort
- Offer withdrawal without penalty
- Celebrate boundary-setting
- Update as relationships evolve

---

## Questions to Ask

Every project should be able to answer:

| Question | Answer Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| Who holds authority here? | Named |
| How do we know? | Evidence |
| Is consent in place? | Yes/No/In progress |
| What's the handover plan? | Documented |
| What stays internal? | Listed |
