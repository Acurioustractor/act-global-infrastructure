# LCAA Methodology

LCAA (Listen, Curiosity, Action, Art) is ACT's core methodology applied across all projects. It's not linear—each phase informs the others in ongoing cycles. Think of it as a story arc we return to.

---

## L - LISTEN

**"We sit in silence to take in knowledge"**

Start with place, people, history, and community voice. We do not assume. We ask.

### Who/What We Listen To
- **Country:** Land teaches systems if we slow down to learn
- **Traditional Owners:** Ancestral knowledge and cultural protocols
- **Community:** Those most impacted by current systems
- **Elders:** Wisdom accumulated across generations
- **Youth:** Vision unencumbered by "how it's always been"
- **The Silenced:** Whose voices have been systematically excluded

### How We Listen
- **Presence:** Being physically present in communities over time
- **Silence:** Quiet before speaking, asking before proposing
- **Story:** Listening for narrative, not just data points
- **Relationship:** Trust-building before agenda-setting
- **Protocol:** Respecting cultural ways of sharing knowledge

### Tools & Practices
- Extended site visits and residencies
- Story circles and yarning sessions
- Elder consultations with proper protocol
- Community-led data gathering
- Observation before intervention

### Output
- Deep understanding of context and complexity
- Relationships of trust and reciprocity
- Community-defined priorities
- Cultural protocols and sensitivities
- Stories that reveal systemic patterns

### Example - Empathy Ledger
Listening revealed that communities wanted to share stories but feared extraction. Current platforms didn't respect cultural protocols or compensate storytellers. This listening phase informed the entire platform design.

## C - CURIOSITY

**"We lean into the unknown with open minds and hearts"**

Ask better questions, think deeply, prototype boldly, test rigorously, and learn continuously.

### Questions We Ask
- **What if?** - "What if communities owned the means of production?"
- **How might we?** - "How might we design for our own obsolescence?"
- **Who says?** - "Who says it has to be this way?"
- **What's possible?** - "What becomes possible if we remove X constraint?"
- **What are we missing?** - "Whose perspective haven't we heard?"

### How We Explore
- **Research:** Deep dives into existing models, failures, edge cases
- **Co-Design:** Ideation sessions with communities as designers
- **Prototyping:** Build to learn, test assumptions early
- **Testing:** Rigorous evaluation of what works (and what doesn't)
- **Iteration:** Rapid cycles of build-measure-learn

### Tools & Practices
- Design thinking workshops with communities
- Rapid prototyping (digital and physical)
- User testing and feedback loops
- Literature reviews and field research
- Systems mapping

### Output
- Multiple solution pathways explored
- Prototypes tested with real users
- Assumptions validated or challenged
- Evidence-based design decisions
- Learning documented for sharing

### Example - Goods on Country
Curiosity asked: "Can waste become community wealth?" This led to exploring circular manufacturing, material science, community ownership models, and cultural production practices. Prototyping 100 beds tested the hypothesis before scaling.

## A - ACTION

**"We are makers who play and take chances"**

Build tangible solutions alongside communities—not for them. Combine innovative technologies, compelling stories, and immersive art.

### What We Build
- **Platforms:** Digital tools for sovereignty (Empathy Ledger, JusticeHub)
- **Products:** Physical goods designed with/for communities (Goods on Country)
- **Spaces:** Places for healing, learning, gathering (BCV, The Harvest)
- **Experiences:** Immersive installations and provocations (Art Program)
- **Systems:** Governance structures, business models, protocols

### How We Build
- **Co-Creation:** Communities as designers and builders
- **Open Source:** Forkable, transparent, community-owned
- **Iterative:** Ship early, gather feedback, improve continuously
- **Documented:** Knowledge shared for replication
- **Sustainable:** Revenue models that outlast our involvement

### Tools & Practices
- Agile development with community stakeholders
- Open-source software development
- Community workshops and build sessions
- Pilot programs and beta testing
- Documentation for handover

### Output
- Working solutions deployed in communities
- Evidence of impact and effectiveness
- Community capacity to operate independently
- Replication toolkits for other communities
- Learning shared openly

### Example - JusticeHub
Action meant building actual platform where communities could share and fork justice programs. Not just documenting models—creating infrastructure for replication and adaptation. Open-source code allows any community to host independently.

## A - ART

**"We recognize art as the first form of revolution"**

Translate change into culture, meaning, and storytelling. Art challenges the status quo, provokes critical thinking, and inspires collective action.

### Forms of Art
- **Installations:** The Gold.Phone, The Confessional, The Treacher
- **Storytelling:** Community narratives, campaign messaging
- **Visual Identity:** Design as expression of values
- **Performance:** Participatory experiences and provocation
- **Land Art:** Country as canvas and teacher
- **Writing:** Poetry, essays, provocative framing

### How Art Functions
- **Consciousness-Shifting:** Opens new ways of seeing
- **Truth-Telling:** Makes invisible visible
- **Imagination:** Reveals futures not yet possible
- **Provocation:** Questions assumed realities
- **Celebration:** Honors community and culture
- **Documentation:** Bears witness to transformation

### Tools & Practices
- Artist residencies at Black Cockatoo Valley
- Community co-creation of artworks
- Participatory installations in public space
- Storytelling as methodology
- Exhibitions and public programs

### Output
- Artworks that shift culture
- Stories that reveal truth
- Experiences that transform perspective
- Cultural artifacts of movement
- Imagination as practical tool

### Example - The Gold.Phone
Nic's hacked vintage payphone randomly connects strangers globally. Thousands of authentic conversations become living archive proving intimacy possible across difference. Art as methodology for exploring connection, not decoration.

## LCAA Loops

Art returns us to Listen. The cycle continues.

### Full Cycle Example: Food Insecurity

**LISTEN (Months 1-3):**
- Extended time in community, not extractive consultation
- Story circles with elders, families, youth
- Understanding cultural protocols around food
- Learning seasonal and historical food practices
- Identifying who's excluded from current food systems

**CURIOSITY (Months 3-6):**
- Researching: CSA models, food sovereignty movements, cultural production
- Asking: What if communities owned food production? How might gardens heal beyond nutrition?
- Prototyping: Small test gardens with community co-design
- Testing: What grows well? What's culturally appropriate? Who participates?

**ACTION (Months 6-18):**
- Building: Community-owned garden infrastructure
- Co-creating: Seasonal programs with therapeutic components
- Establishing: Harvest share distribution systems
- Training: Community members in regenerative practices
- Documenting: Processes for other communities to replicate

**ART (Ongoing):**
- Storytelling: Documenting journeys of participants
- Celebrations: Seasonal feasts as cultural events
- Installations: Garden as public artwork
- Photography: Beauty of hands in soil
- Writing: Essays on food sovereignty and healing

**Result:**
Not just food production, but transformation of relationships to land, culture, health, and each other. Community capacity to continue independently. Model other communities can fork and adapt.
