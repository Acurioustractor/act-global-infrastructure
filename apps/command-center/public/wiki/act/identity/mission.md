# Mission & Identity

## One-liner

A regenerative innovation studio stewarding a working farm on Jinibara Country.

## Full Mission

ACT exists to grow co-stewardship and shared governance through land, story, and action. The farm is held as a commons. The studio is the toolkit communities can hold, shape, and outgrow. We work to dismantle extractive systems through ethical technology, Indigenous data sovereignty, and community-centred design.

## Mission Versions

**30-Second Elevator Pitch:**
"A Curious Tractor partners with First Nations and marginalized communities to dismantle extractive systems. Like a tractor's power take-off, we transfer resources, knowledge, and capacity to community-led initiatives. When communities are ready, we hand over the keys."

**One-Sentence:**
"Regenerative innovation ecosystem transferring power to communities designing their own futures."

## Vision (North Star)

Communities own:
- **Their narratives** - Story sovereignty through platforms like Empathy Ledger
- **Their land** - Conservation and cultural land management
- **Their economic futures** - 40% profit-sharing, community ownership structures

Social, cultural, environmental, and economic value stays in community hands.
Every tool comes with a sunset clause.
Our success is measured by our obsolescence.

## Core Metaphor: The Power Take-Off (PTO)

**What is a PTO?**
A tractor's Power Take-Off is a mechanical interface that transfers the tractor's engine power to attached equipment (plows, mowers, generators). The tractor provides the power; the equipment does the work.

**How ACT Embodies This:**
- **Communities are the equipment** - They're doing the transformative work
- **ACT is the power source** - Providing capacity, resources, connections, methodology
- **The connection is temporary** - Equipment can be connected and disconnected as needed
- **Equipment becomes independent** - Eventually, communities generate their own power

**Application:**
- Capacity-building programs
- Knowledge-sharing and methodology transfer
- Flexible resourcing (attach/detach as needed)
- Network weaving and connection-making
- Infrastructure that communities eventually own and operate

## Core Values

### 1. Radical Humility
We don't have all the answers, but we're cultivating solutions together.

**In Practice:**
- Lead with questions, not solutions
- Acknowledge when we don't know
- Center community expertise over external credentials
- Admit mistakes publicly and learn from them

### 2. Decentralized Power
Communities lead; we support. Every tool has a sunset clause and "forkable" IP.

**In Practice:**
- Open-source everything possible
- Community ownership structures from day one
- Exit strategies built into every project
- Governance structures that shift power to communities

### 3. Creativity as Disruption
Revolution starts with imagination. Art opens possibilities that policy alone never could.

**In Practice:**
- Art integrated into every project, not added at the end
- Provocative installations that shift consciousness
- Artists as systems change agents

### 4. Uncomfortable Truth-Telling
We name extractive systems and work to dismantle them.

**In Practice:**
- Call out extraction, colonization, systemic inequity
- Share community truths even when uncomfortable
- Hold power accountable
- Don't soften messages for funding or comfort

## Design Principles

### Design for Obsolescence
Every project asks: "How does this make ACT unnecessary?"

**Questions to Ask:**
- How will this operate without us?
- When should we exit?
- What capacities must be transferred?
- How do we measure readiness for handover?

### 40% Profit-Sharing
Social, cultural, environmental, and economic value flows back to communities.

**Applied To:**
- Goods on Country manufacturing
- Black Cockatoo Valley eco-cottages
- Art sales and licensing
- Consulting revenue
- Any commercial activity

## The ACT Way: Make Space

> "The best systems are invisible. They create space for humans to be human."

We build tractors and toolkits, not empires. Infrastructure should disappear into the work, make listening easier, keep consent visible, and leave more time for people to gather, make, and lead.

### Identity Before Product

We start with identity and belonging, then build the thing. Events are culture, not marketing. Communities are owners, not audiences.
