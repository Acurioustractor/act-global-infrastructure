# Principles of Practice

These principles are the backbone of the compendium, not slogans or values posters. They are choices we make in rooms, in code, on Country, and in how we show up. When we are unclear, we return here. Each principle links land practice, enterprise, story, and technology into one way of working.

---

## 1. Country Sets the Pace

The land is the teacher and the limiter. We do not scale beyond land capacity or community readiness. Conservation-first is the baseline. If the creek is low or the land is tired, we slow down and listen.

**In Practice:**
- Plan residencies, harvest shares, and enterprise activity to seasons and capacity
- If a project asks for more than the land can give, we redesign the project, not the land
- Conservation-first is the baseline, always

> Field note: When the creek is low or the grass is tired, we slow down. Capacity is a land decision before it is a calendar decision.

---

## 2. Community Authority Comes First

Consent, cultural protocols, and local authority are non-negotiable. OCAP is enforced in code and practice. Elder review is required where culture demands it. Community authority carries the highest weight, even when it complicates delivery.

**In Practice:**
- Authority governs data and images
- If Elders say wait, we wait
- If a partner wants speed over safety, we slow down
- Community veto power on major decisions

---

## 3. Identity Before Product

We start with belonging, not features. Events are culture, not marketing. A gathering counts as an output if it strengthens trust and shared governance. We would rather build slower with the right people than fast with the wrong assumptions.

**In Practice:**
- The Harvest is not just a venue; it is belonging tested in markets, meals, and shared work
- Products are valid only if they strengthen that belonging
- Events build culture, not just mailing lists

---

## 4. Build for Handover (Beautiful Obsolescence)

We design for transfer from day one. Documentation, training, and governance are deliverables. A Curious Tractor means tools can be repaired locally, adapted by communities, and left behind. Success is measured by how well we step back.

**In Practice:**
- Sunset clauses in all partnership agreements
- Community capacity-building from day one
- Documentation for self-hosting and independence
- Handover is planned, not hoped for
- We write playbooks, train caretakers, and build maintenance loops

> Field note: If we cannot hand it over, we are still in Curiosity.

---

## 5. Make with Lived Experience

Lived experience is not advisory; it is core capability. We build pathways for people under-skilled in formal systems but rich in lived knowledge. We hire, train, and design around those who carry the truth of the problem.

**In Practice:**
- Real roles in manufacturing, recycling, maintenance, and storytelling
- Pay for time, design for dignity
- Do not treat lived experience as free labour
- Youth as designers, not just beneficiaries

---

## 6. Enterprise Funds the Commons

Goods, Harvest, and related enterprise fund land care and community value, not extraction. Fair value return and community ownership are non-negotiable. Enterprise keeps the commons alive.

**In Practice:**
- 40% profit-sharing is built into all financial models
- Keep enterprise small enough to be cared for
- Strong enough to fund land care, community wages, and long-term repair
- Transparent accounting and community oversight

---

## 7. Evidence is Story, Not Surveillance

Empathy Ledger is the core impact tool. ALMA is the shared learning lens. We do not profile people. We track system-level signals, learn from consented stories, and change practice in response.

**In Practice:**
- Metrics support learning, but do not lead it
- Stories are evidence because they carry context, harm risk, and authority
- No individual profiling or ranking
- Community controls what's measured and shared

> Field note: We do not measure people. We measure whether the system is learning.

---

## 8. Tools Should Create Space

Infrastructure should be quiet. The Knowledge Hub and Farmhand reduce admin, hold context, and make it easier to do the work that matters. The system is the tractor, the humans are the farmers, the community is the harvest.

**In Practice:**
- The Knowledge Hub is shared memory, not surveillance
- Farmhand should never override community voice; it should make it easier to hear
- Fewer tools, clearer pathways, faster handover
- Technology serves relationships, not replaces them

> Field note: If a system is loud, it is not doing its job. Quiet systems create room for people to show up.

---

## 9. Share with Care

We share what is safe and keep what is sensitive. The shareability matrix is not bureaucracy; it is respect in practice. If a story cannot be told without harm, we do not tell it. We wait and listen again.

**In Practice:**
- External sharing requires clarity about consent scope, cultural sensitivity, and purpose
- We do not trade story for attention
- Sacred knowledge is protected by hard blocks
- Community decides what goes public

**Shareability Matrix:**
| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| INTERNAL ONLY | Working notes, partner nuance, sensitive detail |
| EXTERNAL-LITE | System-level learnings without identifiers |
| EXTERNAL | Explicit consent, cultural review, safe-to-share |

---

## 10. Art Returns Us to Listen

Art is not a layer on top. It is how we make change felt and understood. Art brings us back to listening and keeps the work human. The LCAA loop only completes when Art returns us to Listen.

**In Practice:**
- Residencies, exhibitions, and installations are not endpoints; they are invitations back into practice
- Art woven throughout projects from inception
- Not "let's add some art at the end"
- Creativity reveals what data cannot

---

## Using These Principles

### When Making Decisions
Return to these principles when unclear. Ask:
- Which principle applies here?
- Are we in tension with any principle?
- What would this principle have us do?

### In Project Planning
Every project should be able to answer:
- Who holds authority here, and how do we know?
- How does this strengthen land practice?
- What's the handover plan?

### In Conflict
When principles seem to conflict, prioritize:
1. Country sets the pace
2. Community authority comes first
3. Share with care

These principles are how we keep the work grounded as it grows. We will revisit and revise them as community authority and land practice evolve.
