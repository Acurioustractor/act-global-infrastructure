# ACT Voice Guide

Write in ACT voice: warm, grounded, humble, visionary, professional yet rebellious. Use regenerative metaphors with restraint and avoid corporate jargon.

---

## Voice Characteristics

### 1. Grounded Yet Visionary

**Grounded:**
- Specific examples over abstract concepts
- Practical next steps alongside big vision
- Acknowledge constraints and challenges
- Real stories from real communities
- Honest about what we don't know

**Visionary:**
- Paint pictures of possible futures
- Use metaphor to expand imagination
- Connect individual actions to systemic change
- "Plant seeds today for forests tomorrow"
- Long-term thinking (generations, not quarters)

**Example:**
> "At Black Cockatoo Valley, we're planting 500 native seedlings this year. Each one is a small act toward a future where Glossy Black Cockatoos thrive, Indigenous rangers lead conservation, and communities govern their own land. We're cultivating that future, one seedling at a time."

### 2. Humble Yet Confident

**Humble:**
- "We're learning as we go"
- "Communities teach us that..."
- "We don't have all the answers, but..."
- Acknowledge failures and learning
- Center community expertise over ours

**Confident:**
- Clear about our values and commitments
- Unafraid to name extractive systems
- Specific about what we offer
- Bold in vision and methodology
- Willing to take principled stands

**Example:**
> "We don't claim to have the solution to youth justice—no single organization does. But we've learned from 15+ communities that when young people design their own accountability systems, recidivism drops by 58%. We're confident community-led justice works. We're still learning how to support it best."

### 3. Warm Yet Challenging

**Warm:**
- Welcoming invitation to participate
- Appreciation and celebration
- "Come get your hands dirty with us"
- Inclusive language
- Recognize contributions

**Challenging:**
- Name extractive systems clearly
- Ask hard questions
- Don't soften for comfort
- Invite confrontation with truth
- Call out complicity (including our own)

**Example:**
> "Join us at Black Cockatoo Valley for a working bee—we'll pull weeds, plant natives, share a meal, and honest conversations about what land care really means. Fair warning: this work confronts our collective complicity in land degradation. But it's also joyful, connecting, and transformative."

### 4. Poetic Yet Clear

**Poetic:**
- Use metaphor to illuminate
- Find beauty in language
- Rhythm and flow in writing
- Imagery that evokes emotion
- Memorable phrasing

**Clear:**
- Concrete specifics
- Active voice
- Short sentences when needed
- Jargon-free (or explained)
- Scannable structure

**Example:**
> "Every story is a seed. Some germinate in days; others lie dormant for seasons, waiting for the right conditions. At Empathy Ledger, we're creating the soil where community stories can root, grow, and eventually propagate on their own. Specifically: a platform where you control who sees your story, when, and how it's used. Your narrative, your rules."

## Writing Patterns

### Openings

**For Mission/About:**
Start with metaphor, then ground it.

> "Like a tractor's power take-off, A Curious Tractor transfers capacity to communities driving their own futures. Concretely, this means: open-source tools you can fork, 40% of profits flowing to community ownership, and sunset clauses ensuring we eventually make ourselves obsolete."

**For Project Pages:**
Start with the problem from community perspective.

> "Youth justice systems aren't working. 58% recidivism. Billions spent on detention that traumatizes instead of heals. Meanwhile, community-led programs show drastically better outcomes—but they're fragmented, underfunded, invisible. JusticeHub exists to change that."

**For Stories:**
Start with a specific scene or voice.

> "Brodie Germaine knows these streets intimately. The housing commission at 77 George Street. The house with soft drinks in the back fridge that became a regular target. These aren't stories of shame—they're waypoints on a journey that would lead to something profound."

### Structure: LCAA as Narrative

Use the methodology as narrative arc:

> "We listened first—sitting with youth who'd been through the system, elders who remembered different ways, communities experimenting with alternatives. Their stories revealed a truth: punishment doesn't heal trauma.
>
> That listening sparked curiosity: What if young people designed their own accountability? What if communities governed justice locally?
>
> Action meant building it: JusticeHub as platform where programs can be forked like open-source code.
>
> Art translates it into culture: youth stories as valid evidence, imaginative installations showing alternatives to cages."

### Endings

**Call to Action with Vision:**
> "Join us. Get your hands dirty pulling weeds at Black Cockatoo Valley, share your story on Empathy Ledger, fork a justice program on JusticeHub. Each small action is a seed. Together, we're cultivating a world where communities own their narratives, land, and economic futures."

**Return to Metaphor:**
> "Every story is a seed. Every seed is a possibility. Every possibility is a future we cultivate together."
