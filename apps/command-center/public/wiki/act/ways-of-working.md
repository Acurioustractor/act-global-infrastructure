# Ways of Working (Internal)

Our way of working is part of the output. How we show up is the first signal of trust.

---

## Daily Practice

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Listen first** | If in doubt, pause and return to community voice |
| **Use LCAA** | Structure planning and delivery through the phases |
| **Use ALMA** | Check ethics and learning quality |
| **Ground language** | Keep it non-extractive, honest, no savior framing |
| **Mark nuance** | Tag high-nuance partner details as `[INTERNAL ONLY]` |

---

## ACT Voice

When writing and communicating:

| Quality | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Warm** | Approachable, human, inviting |
| **Grounded** | Based in practice, not theory |
| **Humble** | We don't have all the answers |
| **Visionary** | We see what's possible |
| **Professional yet rebellious** | Serious about the work, questioning the system |

### Do
- Use regenerative metaphors (with restraint)
- Ground claims in lived practice
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Center community voice

### Don't
- Corporate jargon
- Savior framing
- Overclaiming
- Speaking for communities

---

## Internal Calls to Action

These are small, repeatable actions that keep the model real:

1. **Apply the ACT Core Model** to every project plan and update
2. **Route impact learning** through Empathy Ledger and ALMA
3. **Keep enterprise pathways** practical and community-led (Harvest, Goods)
4. **Protect consent and cultural protocols** at every stage
5. **Review claims** before external sharing

> Field note: If a call to action cannot be done this week, it is not a call to action.

---

## Meeting Practice

### Before Meetings
- Clear purpose documented
- Right people invited
- Materials shared in advance

### During Meetings
- Listen before speaking
- Note who holds authority
- Capture next actions clearly

### After Meetings
- Actions distributed within 24 hours
- Consent confirmed where needed
- LCAA phase noted

---

## Knowledge Capture

Weekly rhythms:
- Update our agent system with project slugs and ALMA signals
- Capture learnings in the appropriate space (Telegram or Discord)
- Review shareability before any external communication

---

## Media Governance

Empathy Ledger is the source of truth for:
- Stories
- Photos
- Video
- Consent records

Before using any media:
1. Check consent status
2. Verify current (not expired)
3. Confirm appropriate scope
4. Attribute properly

---

## Data Hygiene

Every record should have:
- Clear ownership
- Version tracking
- Consent flags
- Review date

---

## Infrastructure Philosophy

> Field note: If a system is loud, it is not doing its job. Quiet systems create room for people to show up.

- Fewer tools, clearer pathways
- Faster handover
- Quiet reliability
- Infrastructure serves the work, not the other way around

---

## Conflict Navigation

When principles seem to conflict, prioritize:

1. **Country sets the pace** — Land and community readiness first
2. **Community authority comes first** — Their voice, their decision
3. **Share with care** — If uncertain, keep internal

---

## Process Is Product

> Field note: The process is the product. If it is not respectful, the outcome will not be either.

How we work reflects what we believe. Every interaction is an expression of values.
