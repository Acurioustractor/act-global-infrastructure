# 2026 Roadmap (Working)

This is a seasonal map, not a fixed plan. We choose readiness over deadlines and build what the land, community, and team can hold.

> Field note: A roadmap is a promise to keep learning, not a promise to move faster.

---

## Q1 (Jan–Mar)

| Priority | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Finalise compendium and align project language to core model | In Progress |
| Stabilise Harvest operations and maker pathways in Witta | In Progress |
| Confirm Goods production readiness and support pathways | Planning |
| Align AI agent guardrails to ALMA and Empathy Ledger | Complete |
| JusticeHub vision and path to externalise | Planning |
| ACT regular communication (1-to-some and 1-to-many via GHL) | In Progress |

---

## Q2 (Apr–Jun)

| Priority | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Strengthen Goods manufacturing consistency and maintenance loops | Planned |
| Embed Empathy Ledger as common impact layer across projects | Planned |
| Improve cross-project coordination and shared learning | Planned |

---

## Q3 (Jul–Sep)

| Priority | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Expand enterprise pathways where community readiness allows | Planned |
| Prototype next essential in Goods (fridge pathway) if capacity ready | Planned |
| Publish internal learning notes for team use | Planned |

---

## Q4 (Oct–Dec)

| Priority | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Review readiness for deeper co-stewardship pathways | Planned |
| Assess enterprise sustainability and next-year focus | Planned |
| Document what should be handed over in 2027 | Planned |

## 2026 Focus Areas

### 1. Land Stewardship with Shared Governance
- Keep conservation-first practice as the baseline
- Prepare co-stewardship groundwork (relationship, protocol, readiness)
- Scale land programs to land capacity and community readiness

### 2. Innovation Studio and Product Work
- Build tools that serve community ownership, not dependence
- Prioritise clarity, simplicity, and handover readiness
- Use stories and evidence to guide product direction

### 3. The Harvest as Grounded Enterprise (Witta)
- Support local makers and micro-enterprise through markets, workshops, venue hire
- Build community connection through practical enterprise
- Prioritise sustainable, community-led, innovation-ready enterprise

### 4. Goods on Country Manufacturing
- Move Goods from pilots to reliable production
- Strengthen supply chains, quality, and local capability
- Hold community ownership and fair value return as non-negotiables

### 5. Story and Evidence
- Treat storytelling as infrastructure for change, not marketing
- Protect consent and cultural protocols in every output
- Use evidence to learn, not to extract
- Anchor impact learning in ALMA and Empathy Ledger

## Risks and Dependencies

Naming risk early is part of stewardship. We do not hide it in the margins.

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Capacity risk** | Small team carrying multi-project delivery — fewer priorities, deeper focus |
| **Consent risk** | Misuse of stories or data — clear protocols, regular review |
| **Enterprise risk** | Supply chain and operational reliability — build slowly, local first |
| **Land risk** | Overextension beyond capacity — land veto, seasonal planning |
| **AI risk** | Misalignment or extractive outputs — ALMA gatekeeping, community override |

> Field note: The risk we ignore is the one that shows up in the work.

## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Check quarterly** — Are we on track? What's shifted?
2. **Adjust to capacity** — If overwhelmed, reduce scope
3. **Note learnings** — What did this quarter teach us?
4. **Plan next quarter** — Based on reality, not aspiration
