# Visual System

Visuals are teaching tools, not decoration. They should make the model legible, protect consent, and help someone take the next right action. Every image should be traceable to a story, place, or decision.

> "We do not use beautiful imagery to cover thin practice. The image has to earn its place."

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Consent-First
- Every asset links back to an Empathy Ledger record or explicit consent note
- No faces without explicit consent, even in internal drafts
- No charts that imply individual profiling or ranking
- If a visual cannot be traced to consent, it does not belong

### 2. Teaching Over Decoration
- Diagrams explain, not impress
- Photos show real work, not staged moments
- Charts illuminate patterns, not extract data
- Every visual should answer "what should I do next?"

### 3. Grounded Aesthetics
- Warm, earthy tones reflecting land practice
- Clean, accessible design
- Professional without being corporate
- Regenerative metaphors visible but not forced

## Core Visuals to Build

### 1. ACT Core Model Map
**Purpose:** Show the relationship between land practice, enterprise, LCAA, and ALMA

```
                    LAND PRACTICE
                    (BCV, Country)
                         ↕
         ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
         ↓               ↓               ↓
    ENTERPRISE ←──── LCAA ────→ IMPACT
   (Goods, Harvest)  (Method)   (ALMA)
         ↓               ↓               ↓
         └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                         ↓
                    COMMUNITY
                   (Ownership)
```

**Placement:** Section 1, website home

### 2. LCAA Loop
**Purpose:** Show the methodology with 2026 examples

```
        LISTEN
           ↓
    What voices are
    we hearing?
           ↓
      CURIOSITY ←────────┐
           ↓              │
    What if we tried      │
    something different?  │
           ↓              │
       ACTION             │
           ↓              │
    Build, test,          │

           ↓              │
        ART               │
           ↓              │

    shareable             │
           └──────────────┘
```

**Placement:** Section 2 (methodology), project pages

### 3. ALMA Reporting Loop
**Purpose:** Show how stories become learning

```
   STORY ──→ SIGNAL ──→ SHIFT ──→ SCOPE
     ↑                              │
     └──────────────────────────────┘
              (feedback)
```

**Detailed version:**
- Story: Consented narrative captured
- Signal: ALMA metrics applied
- Shift: LCAA decision made
- Scope: Action taken, monitored

**Placement:** Section 12-15, impact reporting

### 4. Enterprise Pathway Loops
**Purpose:** Show local capability and maintenance flows

**Goods on Country:**
```
   COMMUNITY NEED
         ↓
   DESIGN (with community)
         ↓
   MANUFACTURE (local)
         ↓
   DISTRIBUTE
         ↓
   MAINTAIN/REPAIR ←── RECYCLE
         ↓
   40% RETURNS TO COMMUNITY
```

**The Harvest:**

         ↓
   GROW/MAKE
         ↓
   COMMUNITY ENTERPRISE
         ↓
   REVENUE
         ↓
   REINVEST IN LAND
```

**Placement:** Project pages, ecosystem section

### 5. Ecosystem Map
**Purpose:** Show outputs, expressions, and community governance

```
OUTPUTS                           EXPRESSIONS
(What we build)                   (How it shows up)
─────────────                     ──────────────
Empathy Ledger ──────────────────→ Story sovereignty
JusticeHub ──────────────────────→ Community justice
Goods on Country ────────────────→ Essential goods
The Harvest ─────────────────────→ Local enterprise
Black Cockatoo Valley ───────────→ Land practice

              ↓
        COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE
       (Beautiful Obsolescence)
```

**Placement:** Section 8-9, website about page

### 6. Consent and Data Flow Map
**Purpose:** Show Empathy Ledger as source of truth

```
   STORY CREATED
         ↓
   CONSENT SET (granular)
         ↓
   EMPATHY LEDGER (source of truth)
         ↓
   ┌─────┴─────┐
   ↓           ↓

## Diagram Style

### Approach
