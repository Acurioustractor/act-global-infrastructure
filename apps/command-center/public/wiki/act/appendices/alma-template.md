## Healthcare Workers Finding Renewal at June's Patch

**Project:** junes-patch
**Place / Country:** Black Cockatoo Valley, Jinibara Country
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Consent Scope:** EXTERNAL-LITE
**Review Status:** Approved

---

### Story Summary

After 18 months of COVID burnout, a group of nurses from Sunshine Coast
Health discovered June's Patch through a colleague. "I'd forgotten what
it felt like to just... be still," one participant shared. The program
combines therapeutic horticulture with structured rest, and early
feedback suggests significant wellbeing improvements.

---

### ALMA Signals

| Signal | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Evidence Strength | 3 | Consistent feedback, USC research underway |
| Community Authority | 4 | Healthcare workers shaping program design |
| Harm Risk (inverted) | 5 | No foreseeable harm, positive intent |
| Implementation Capability | 4 | Program running, capacity available |
| Option Value | 4 | Opens partnership with health sector |
| Community Value Return | 4 | Direct wellbeing benefit, fair pricing |

**Overall ALMA Score:** 4.0

---

### LCAA Reflection

**Listen:** Healthcare workers are exhausted and disconnected from
nature. Traditional wellness programs don't address the depth of burnout.

**Curiosity:** What if nature itself could be prescribed? What if
growing food was part of healing?

**Action:** Expand June's Patch capacity for Q2; explore "prescription
to nature" partnership with local GPs.

**Art:** Photo series (with consent) of hands in soil, faces at rest.
Video vignette for healthcare sector outreach.

### What Should Remain Internal

- Individual participant names and health details
- Specific hospital partnerships in discussion
- Pricing negotiations with health insurers

### Media Linked

| Asset | Type | Consent Status | Empathy Ledger ID |
|-------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Hands in soil series | Photo | Consented | EL-2026-0142 |

### Next Steps

1. Complete USC ethics approval for formal research
2. Develop GP partnership proposal
3. Create external-ready story vignette

## Integration with Empathy Ledger

All story captures should:

1. **Link to Empathy Ledger** - Use story ID for traceability
2. **Respect consent scope** - Never exceed stated permissions
3. **Update on change** - Refresh consent annually or on use
4. **Archive properly** - Stories don't disappear, they move to archive
