# ALMA: Authentic Learning for Meaningful Accountability

ALMA is our shared impact-and-learning model. It helps us notice system-level patterns without profiling people and keeps community authority central. ALMA is a way of paying attention, not scoring.

---

## Core Principle

> We do not measure people. We measure whether the system is learning.

ALMA reads signals at a **system level**, not an individual level. Learning feeds back into LCAA and informs product and enterprise choices.

---

## How ALMA Works

### The Flow

```
Community Stories (Empathy Ledger)
         ↓
    ALMA Signals (system-level patterns)
         ↓
    Learning & Reflection
         ↓
    LCAA Practice Changes
         ↓
    Better Outcomes
```

### Empathy Ledger Connection

- Community stories live in Empathy Ledger with consent controls
- ALMA reads signals from consented stories
- Individual identities are protected
- System-level patterns inform decisions

---

## ALMA Signal Families

These are the lenses we use to read system-level learning:

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Evidence Strength** | How reliable is the learning? What's the source? |
| **Community Authority** | Who holds authority here? Is consent in place? |
| **Harm Risk** (inverted) | What could go wrong? Who might be harmed? |
| **Implementation Capability** | Can this be done well? Is capacity ready? |
| **Option Value** | Does this open or close future possibilities? |
| **Community Value Return** | Does value flow back to community? |

---

## ALMA in Reporting

Every piece of evidence should include:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Story** | A consented narrative or quote from Empathy Ledger |
| **Signal** | ALMA lens notes at system level (not individual) |
| **Shift** | What we changed or will change in practice (LCAA step) |
| **Scope** | What is shareable now vs internal-only |

---

## ALMA Capture Prompts

When gathering evidence, ask:

1. **What did we hear, and who holds authority?**
2. **What system-level shift is emerging?**
3. **What harm risk or consent boundary must be held?**
4. **What practical change do we commit to next?**
5. **What should remain internal for now?**

---

## ALMA Data Anchors

Every ALMA record should have:

- Story record (Empathy Ledger ID)
- Consent scope and cultural sensitivity level
- Project slugs and place/Country
- ALMA signal tags and LCAA stage

---

## What ALMA Is Not

| ALMA Is | ALMA Is Not |
|---------|------------|
| System-level learning | Individual profiling |
| Patterns across stories | Scoring or ranking people |
| Community-controlled | Externally imposed |
| Consent-first | Surveillance |
| Practice-changing | Report-generating |

---

## ALMA and Empathy Ledger

**Empathy Ledger** holds:
- Consented stories
- Community voice
- Evidence with cultural protocols

**ALMA** provides:
- A lens for reading patterns
- System-level signal categories
- Learning-to-practice feedback loop

Together they ensure:
- Community controls narrative
- ACT learns at system level
- Practice changes in response
- No individual profiling

---

## Field Notes

> "If a story cannot be told without harm, we do not tell it. The signal stays internal until it is safe."

> "Evidence serves relationships, not reports. We count what we can, but we listen to what we cannot."

> "ALMA is not about proving impact. It's about staying accountable to learning."

## ALMA Reporting Template

```markdown
**Title:** [Story/learning title]
**Project:** [project slug]
**Place / Country:** [location]
**Consent scope:** [INTERNAL ONLY | EXTERNAL-LITE | EXTERNAL]

**Story (summary or quote):**
[Consented narrative from Empathy Ledger]

**ALMA Signals:**
- Evidence strength: [description]
- Community authority: [who holds it]
- Harm risk (inverted): [risks identified]
- Implementation capability: [readiness level]
- Option value: [future possibilities]
- Community value return: [how value flows back]

**LCAA shift (what we will change):**
[Practical change committed]

**Media linked:** [photo | video | audio | diagram]
**Review status:** [pending | approved | restricted]
```
