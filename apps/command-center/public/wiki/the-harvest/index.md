# The Harvest

> Regenerative agriculture and community food systems

## Philosophy

The Harvest connects regenerative producers with conscious consumers, building **food systems that heal rather than harm**.

Industrial agriculture extracts from land and community. The Harvest inverts this by:

- Supporting regenerative farming practices
- Shortening supply chains to keep value local
- Celebrating seasonal, place-based eating
- Building relationships between eaters and growers

## Regenerative Principles

We work with producers who practice:

- **Soil health** - Building rather than depleting soil carbon
- **Biodiversity** - Working with nature's complexity
- **Water stewardship** - Protecting and restoring watersheds
- **Community connection** - Food as relationship, not commodity

## LCAA Framework

### Listen
Understanding what regenerative producers need to thrive. What barriers prevent sustainable farming? What would help them scale?

### Curiosity
Exploring models for regenerative food systems. Learning from traditional Indigenous land management and contemporary permaculture.

### Action
Building infrastructure for regenerative food:
- Direct producer-consumer connections
- Seasonal subscription boxes
- Restaurant and institution partnerships
- Producer support and training

### Art
Storytelling that reconnects people with their food. Every meal has a story of land, labor, and love.

## Food as Medicine

The Harvest recognizes food as:
- **Physical nourishment** - Nutrient-dense, clean food
- **Cultural connection** - Traditional foods and practices
- **Community building** - Shared meals and markets
- **Economic justice** - Fair prices for producers

## Producer Network

Our network includes:
- Regenerative farms and market gardens
