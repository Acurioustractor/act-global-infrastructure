# Empathy Ledger

> Community storytelling that centers data sovereignty

## Philosophy

Empathy Ledger puts storytelling power back in community hands. We believe **stories are data**, and communities should control how their stories are shared and used.

Traditional impact measurement extracts stories from communities for external purposes. Empathy Ledger inverts this by:

- Giving storytellers ownership of their content
- Allowing communities to decide who can access their stories
- Measuring impact through community-defined metrics
- Building trust through transparency and consent

## Data Sovereignty

Every storyteller owns their content. They decide:
- Who can access their stories
- How they can be used
- When to revoke access

This is **true data sovereignty** - not just privacy, but genuine ownership and control.

## ALMA Framework

ALMA (Active Listening, Measuring, Amplifying) is our methodology for capturing impact through stories:

### Active Listening
Creating safe spaces for community members to share their stories. Training facilitators in trauma-informed practices. Building trust before asking for stories.

### Measuring
Connecting lived experience to measurable outcomes. Using AI analysis to identify themes and patterns while keeping human judgment central.

### Amplifying
Sharing stories (with consent) to influence policy, practice, and public understanding. Ensuring communities benefit from how their stories are used.

## LCAA Framework

### Listen
Creating safe spaces for community members to share their stories.

### Curiosity
Understanding how stories can measure and communicate impact in ways that quantitative data cannot.

### Action
Building technology that gives communities control over their narratives while generating meaningful insights.

### Art
Amplifying voices through multimedia storytelling - audio, video, written, visual.
