# Black Cockatoo Valley

Black Cockatoo Valley is a 150-acre property on Jinibara Country near Witta, Queensland. Conservation-first, we work with Country, not on it. The land sets the pace; we do not scale beyond what the land and community can carry.

---

## Land Practice Philosophy

### Conservation-First

The land is the teacher and the limiter. Conservation-first is the baseline, always.

> Field note: When the creek is low or the grass is tired, we slow down. Capacity is a land decision before it is a calendar decision.

### Key Commitments

| Commitment | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Low-impact activity** | No extractive tourism, limited-volume operations |
| **Revenue reinvested** | Residencies and workshops fund restoration, weed management, monitoring |
| **Long-term stewardship** | Community co-stewardship and beautiful obsolescence as the goal |
| **Conservation boundaries** | Scale to land capacity and community readiness, not demand |

---

## 2026 Focus

Balance land management with studio innovation, product development, and enterprise delivery:

1. **Protect land capacity** — Conservation-first guardrails maintained
2. **Run The Harvest in Witta** — Small, practical enterprise hub (separate site)
3. **Push Goods** toward manufacturing and operational maturity
4. **Treat stories and technology** as core instruments of stewardship, not add-ons

> Land practice remains central alongside innovation and enterprise. Every project should explain how it strengthens land practice.

| **Goods** | Manufacturing and maintenance grounded in place |
| **Empathy Ledger** | Stories from and about Country |
| **JusticeHub** | On-Country healing as justice alternative |
| **The Harvest** | Local enterprise supporting land care revenue |
| **The Studio** | Technology serving conservation goals |

## Principles Applied

### Country Sets the Pace

> If a project asks for more than the land can give, we redesign the project, not the land.

We plan residencies, harvest shares, and enterprise activity to seasons and capacity. When capacity is limited:
- We reduce, not push through
- We wait, not accelerate
- We learn, not force

### Conservation Boundaries

The land has veto power:
- No activities during sensitive seasons
- Habitat areas are protected
- Water systems respected
- Wildlife corridors maintained

---

## Co-Stewardship Vision

Long-term aim: community co-stewardship and beautiful obsolescence.

This means:
- Preparing governance structures for shared ownership
- Building relationships over years, not months
- Transferring capability and authority gradually
- Being ready to step back when community is ready

---

## Field Notes

> "We do not scale beyond land capacity or community readiness."

> "The creek tells us more than the calendar."

> "If we're too busy to notice the birds, we're too busy."
