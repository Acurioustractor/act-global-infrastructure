# Place & Land Practice

ACT's work is grounded in place. Land practice is central to everything we do—not an add-on or afterthought, but the foundation that shapes how we work.

## Core Principle

> Country Sets the Pace

The land is the teacher and the limiter. We do not scale beyond land capacity or community readiness. Conservation-first is the baseline.

## How Land Practice Shapes Our Work

Every project connects back to land:

- **Goods** — Manufacturing grounded in place and local materials
- **Empathy Ledger** — Stories from and about Country
- **JusticeHub** — On-Country healing as an alternative to detention
- **The Harvest** — Enterprise that funds land care
- **The Studio** — Technology serving conservation goals

---

## Jinibara Country

ACT operates on Jinibara Country. This shapes:

- How we relate to the land
- Our responsibility to Traditional Owners
- Our approach to cultural protocols
- Our commitment to co-stewardship
