# The Studio

> Creative technology and regenerative design

## Philosophy

The Studio is where **technology serves community**, not the other way around. We believe technology should amplify human connection, make itself unnecessary, and leave communities more capable than before.

Most tech extracts data, attention, and value from communities. The Studio inverts this by:

- Building technology that communities own and control
- Designing for community benefit, not engagement metrics
- Open-sourcing everything we can
- Training communities to maintain and evolve their own systems

## Design Principles

### Regenerative by Default
Every system we build should leave things better than we found them - more connected, more capable, more sovereign.

### Community Ownership
Technology belongs to the communities it serves. We build for handover, not dependency.

### Appropriate Technology
The right tool for the context. Sometimes that's high-tech, sometimes it's no-tech.

### Privacy & Sovereignty
Data stays with communities. Systems work offline. No surveillance capitalism.

## LCAA Framework

### Listen
Understanding what communities actually need from technology. Not what we think they need, what they tell us they need.

### Curiosity
Exploring emerging technologies through a regenerative lens. What serves community? What extracts from it?

### Action
Building tools for the ACT ecosystem:
- Empathy Ledger platform
- JusticeHub systems
- Goods marketplace
- Command Center (this platform)

### Art
Designing beautiful, intuitive interfaces that respect users. Technology as craft.

## Tech Stack

We build with:
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Supabase, Vercel
- **AI**: Claude, local models where appropriate
