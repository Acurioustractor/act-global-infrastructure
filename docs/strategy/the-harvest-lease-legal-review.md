# The Harvest Lease Agreement - Legal Review
## Queensland Commercial Lease Analysis for A Curious Tractor

**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** DRAFT - Seek Independent Legal Advice Before Signing
**Jurisdiction:** Queensland, Australia

---

## Executive Summary

This lease agreement contains several **non-standard provisions** that create significant risk for ACT as tenant. While the overall structure is reasonable, there are critical gaps and provisions that heavily favor the landlord. Key concerns:

| Issue | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Retail Shop Leases Act may NOT apply | HIGH | Confirm premises size |
| $100K improvement fund - landlord owns all | HIGH | Negotiate ownership/clawback |
| Revenue share uncapped exposure | MEDIUM | Add natural breakpoint |
| No personal guarantee clause (but may be added) | HIGH | Negotiate caps if required |
| Make good provisions unclear | MEDIUM | Add condition report requirement |
| No QCAT access for disputes | HIGH | Strengthen mediation clause |

**Overall Assessment:** Agreement requires **significant amendment** before signing.

---

## 1. Does the Retail Shop Leases Act 1994 Apply?

### The Test
The Act applies ONLY if:
1. Premises are **less than 1,000 sqm**, AND
2. Used for **retail business** (sales of goods/services to public)

### This Lease
- Building: ~500 sqm ✅ Under threshold
- Garden centre: Additional area (measure!)
- Use: Cafe, retail, community hub = **likely retail**

### Critical Question
**Is total leased area (building + garden + outdoor) under or over 1,000 sqm?**

| Scenario | Act Applies? | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Total < 1,000 sqm | YES | Strong tenant protections, QCAT access |
| Total ≥ 1,000 sqm | NO | Minimal protection, courts only |

### If Act Applies - You Get:
- Mandatory 7-day disclosure statement (not received!)
- Minimum 5-year occupancy right
- Ratchet clauses void
- Land tax cannot be passed to tenant
- QCAT jurisdiction (up to $750K)
- Option exercise reminder required

### ⚠️ ACTION: Measure total leased area immediately. If under 1,000 sqm, request disclosure statement.

---

## 2. Revenue Share Analysis (Clause 3.2)

### Current Structure
```
Base Rent: $50,000/year
+ Revenue Share: 50% of Net Profit
= Capped at $100,000/year total
```

### Issues Identified

| Issue | Current Lease | Best Practice | Risk |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------|
| Breakpoint | None specified | Natural breakpoint = $50K ÷ 0.50 = $100K | Overpayment risk |
| Gross Revenue definition | Very broad | Exclude refunds, GST, insurance payouts | Inflated calculation |
| Operating Costs definition | "Reasonable" only | Specific list with exclusions | Disputes |
| Audit rights | Landlord has full access | Limit frequency (1x/year) | Burden |
| Sales from subtenants | Included? Unclear | Exclude sublease income from calculation | Double-counting |

### Recommended Amendments

```markdown
**Add to Clause 3.2:**

(e) Natural Breakpoint: Revenue Share Rent shall only apply to
    Net Profit exceeding $[X] per annum (the "Breakpoint").

(f) Gross Revenue Exclusions: The following shall be excluded:
    - GST collected
    - Refunds and returns
    - Insurance proceeds
    - Sublease/licence income (reported separately)
    - Grants and donations
    - Inter-company transfers

(g) Operating Costs shall include (without limitation):
    - All wages and superannuation
    - All supplies and inventory
    - All utilities and outgoings
    - Professional fees
    - Marketing and advertising
    - Repairs and maintenance
    - Insurance premiums
    - Bank fees and merchant charges

(h) Operating Costs shall exclude:
    - Owner drawings or distributions
    - Capital expenditure over $[5,000]
    - Depreciation (non-cash)
    - Income tax

(i) Audit: Landlord may request one (1) audit per financial year
    at Landlord's cost unless material discrepancy found.
```

## 3. Capital Improvement Fund (Clause 5) - CRITICAL

### Current Structure
- ACT contributes $100,000
- ACT manages the fund
- Landlord approves expenditures
- **ALL improvements become landlord's property upon termination**

### Legal/Tax Implications

| Issue | Impact | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **No depreciation** | ACT cannot claim capital works deduction (2.5-4% p.a.) | Restructure as rent prepayment or tenant-owned |
| **No exit value** | If lease ends early, ACT loses entire investment | Add proportional clawback |
| **Cost overrun risk** | ACT manages but doesn't control scope | Cap ACT exposure at $100K |
| **Quality disputes** | Landlord may claim poor workmanship | Pre-agreed specifications |

### Tax Analysis (ATO Division 43)

If ACT **owns** improvements:
- Claim 2.5% p.a. deduction = $2,500/year tax benefit
- Over 13 months = minimal benefit anyway

If **landlord owns** (current draft):
- No deduction available to ACT
- Payment not taxable to ACT (capital, not income)
- But ACT has zero recovery on exit

### Recommended Amendments

```markdown
**Replace Clause 5.2(e) with:**

(e) Ownership and Recovery of Improvements:

    (i) Improvements funded by the Capital Improvement Fund
        shall be categorized as:

        Category A (Structural/Permanent): Become Landlord property
        Category B (Removable/Operational): Remain Tenant property

    (ii) Upon early termination (before end of Initial Term or
         any exercised Option):

         - Tenant entitled to recover a proportion of Category A
           expenditure calculated as:

           Recovery = Expenditure × (Remaining Months ÷ 60)

         - Where "Remaining Months" means months remaining in
           the Initial Term plus any exercised Option period.

    (iii) No clawback shall apply if termination is due to
          Landlord default or mutual agreement.

**Add Clause 5.4:**

5.4 Expenditure Cap:

    The Tenant's total liability under the Capital Improvement
    Fund shall not exceed $100,000. Any cost overruns shall be
    subject to separate agreement between the parties.

5.5 Specifications:

    All works shall be undertaken in accordance with
    specifications agreed in writing before commencement.
```

## 4. Subletting (Clause 8)

### Current Lease
- Subletting permitted without landlord consent ✅
- Subject to alignment with permitted use
- Tenant remains liable

### Property Law Act 2023 (from 1 August 2025)
- Landlord **must not unreasonably withhold consent**
- Must respond within **1 month**
- **Cannot be contracted out of**

### Assessment
Current clause is **more favorable** than statute - good for ACT.

### Minor Improvement
```markdown
**Add to Clause 8.1:**

(e) The Tenant shall notify the Landlord in writing within
    14 days of any sublease or licence being granted,
    providing the subtenant name, area, and permitted use.
```

---

## 5. Option to Extend (Clause 2.4)

### Current Lease
- 2-year option
- 90 days notice required
- No rent review mechanism specified

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Strict compliance required | Miss deadline = lose option | Calendar reminder system |
| Email service unclear | May not be valid notice | Specify email is acceptable |
| Rent for option period undefined | Landlord may demand market rent | Add rent review mechanism |
| Breach disqualifies | Late rent payment = lose option | Add cure period |

### Recommended Amendments

```markdown
**Replace Clause 2.4 with:**

2.4 Option to Extend:

(a) The Tenant has the option to extend this lease for an
    additional period of two (2) years ("Option Period").

(b) The option shall be exercised by the Tenant providing
    written notice to the Landlord:
    - Not more than 180 days before expiry of Initial Term
    - Not less than 90 days before expiry of Initial Term

(c) Notice may be given by email to the address specified
    in this agreement, with delivery deemed complete upon
    sending (provided no delivery failure notification).

(d) Rent for the Option Period:
    - Base Rent shall be the greater of:
      (i) The Base Rent for the final year of Initial Term, OR
      (ii) Market rent as determined by agreement, or failing
           agreement, by a licensed valuer appointed by the
           President of the REIQ.
    - Revenue Share arrangements continue unchanged.

(e) The Tenant's right to exercise the option shall not be
    affected by minor breaches that are remedied within
    14 days of written notice from the Landlord.
```

## 6. Make Good (Clause 15)

### Current Lease
- Return in "good condition"
- Remove tenant's property
- "Approved improvements remaining"

### Issues

| Issue | Risk | Solution |
|-------|------|----------|
| No condition report | Disputes over original state | Mandatory report |
| "Good condition" undefined | Subjective standard | Reference condition report |
| No cap on make good costs | Unlimited exposure | Negotiate cap |
| Capital Fund improvements | Unclear which stay | Clarify per Category A/B |

### Recommended Amendments

```markdown
**Add Clause 15.3:**

15.3 Condition Report:

(a) Within 14 days of the Commencement Date, the parties
    shall jointly complete a detailed condition report with
    photographs ("Condition Report").

(b) Upon termination, the Tenant's make good obligations
    shall be assessed against the Condition Report, with
    allowance for fair wear and tear.

(c) The Landlord's make good claim shall not exceed $[20,000]
    unless the Tenant has caused damage beyond fair wear
    and tear, evidenced by comparison to the Condition Report.
```

## 7. Personal Guarantee - NOT IN DRAFT

### Current Status
The draft **does not include** a personal guarantee clause.

### Reality
Landlords commonly require directors to personally guarantee:
- All rent obligations
- Make good costs
- Damages claims

### If Grant Requests Personal Guarantee

**Negotiate these protections:**

```markdown
**If personal guarantee required, add:**

PERSONAL GUARANTEE

1. [Name] ("Guarantor") guarantees payment of amounts due
   under this lease, subject to the following limitations:

2. Maximum Liability: The Guarantor's total liability shall
   not exceed $[50,000] (being [X] months Base Rent).

3. Expiry: This guarantee expires upon:
   (a) Completion of the Initial Term without breach, OR
   (b) 12 months of rental payments being made on time,
       whichever occurs first.

4. Excluded Amounts: The guarantee does not extend to:
   (a) Revenue Share Rent above Base Rent
   (b) Costs arising from Landlord's breach
   (c) Improvements or capital expenditure

5. Notice: Landlord must give Guarantor 14 days written
   notice before making demand under this guarantee.

6. No Charging Clause: The Guarantor does not charge any
   property as security for this guarantee.
```

## 8. Food Business / Commercial Kitchen (Clause 7.2)

- Subject to permits and approvals
- Plans to be provided

### Queensland Requirements

|----------|-----------|-----------|------|

    if food is prepared or sold on premises

```

---

## 10. Dispute Resolution (Clause 16)

### Current Lease
- Good faith negotiation
- Mediation
- Courts

### Critical Issue

- Magistrates Court (< $150K)

     determination shall be final and binding.

16.4 Court Proceedings:
     Either party may commence proceedings only after
     completing steps 16.1-16.2 (except for urgent
     injunctive relief).
