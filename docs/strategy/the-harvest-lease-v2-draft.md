**Recommendation:** Option B or C - matches Grant's verbal generosity and gives runway to get revenue flowing.

### 2. The $100K Improvement Fund (Clause 5)

**Critical question: Where does this $100K come from?**

| Source | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| ACT raises/contributes it | ACT needs the clawback protection - non-negotiable |
| Grant provides it | Less need for clawback, but still want Category B ownership |
| Split contribution | Proportional recovery based on contribution |

**Recommendation:** Clarify funding source with Grant. If ACT contributes ANY amount, the recovery clause (5.4) is essential.

---

### 3. First Right of Refusal (Clause 17.7)

**Why this matters:** Grant may want to sell "with margin" - if he does, without this clause, a new owner could:
- Increase rent dramatically
- Change lease terms
- Not renew
- Evict for redevelopment

**Grant may resist this.** Alternatives:
- First right at market value (not matching any offer)
- First right only during lease term (not after)
- Remove entirely but negotiate longer option period

**Recommendation:** Keep it in draft. Worth asking for - Grant can negotiate down.

---

### 4. Personal Guarantee

**This is NOT in the draft** (intentionally).

**Grant may request one.** If he does:

| His Ask | Your Counter |
|---------|--------------|
| Unlimited guarantee | Capped at $30K (6 months rent) |
| Both directors | One director only |
| Full term | Expires after 12 months good payment |
| Includes revenue share | Base rent only |

**Recommendation:** Don't offer it. If Grant asks, negotiate hard.

---

### 5. Susie Arrangement - Legal Structure

**The arrangement:** Susie works 4 days/week in exchange for free rent ($450/week)

**Legal considerations:**
- Is this employment or contractor?
- If employment: superannuation, leave, workers comp
- If contractor: needs ABN, own insurance

**Options:**
| Structure | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| Employed by ACT | Clear, protected, super | Payroll admin, leave liability |
| Contractor | Simple, flexible | Sham contracting risk |
| Sub-tenant with work-for-rent | Unusual but valid | Document clearly |

**Recommendation:** Employ Susie properly. The $23K "cost" should include super (11.5%) making it ~$26K. Still much cheaper than external Site Manager.

---

### 6. Garden Help Cost ($80/hr)

**Per meeting notes:** Concerned about $80/hr for 2 days/week = ~$12,800/year

**Questions:**
- Is this from the $100K fund or operational cost?
- Can this be reduced? Volunteer coordination? Cath taking it on?
- What's the deliverable/outcome expected?

**Recommendation:** Define scope and cap expenditure. If from $100K fund, it depletes capital fast.

---

### 7. What to Measure Before Sending

**Total premises area** - Critical for Retail Shop Leases Act protection

If total < 1,000 sqm: You get strong statutory protections, QCAT access
If total ≥ 1,000 sqm: This contract is your only protection

**Get from Grant:**
- Site plan with measurements
- Actual outgoings for past 12 months
- Any existing permits/approvals
- Building compliance certificates

---

### 8. Timeline Discussion

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Now | Internal agreement on key points |
| This week | Send v2 draft to Grant |
| Within 2 weeks | Grant's feedback/negotiation |
| End of January | Final agreement signed |
| February | Permits, setup, Susie onboarding |
| March | Soft launch |
| April | Full operations, first full rent payment |

---

### 9. Risk/Reward Summary

| Factor | Risk | Reward | Net |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| Location | - | Only retail in Witta | ++ |
| Rent structure | Revenue share complexity | Below-market base | + |
| $100K fund | Capital at risk | Site improvements | Neutral (with clawback) |
| Grant relationship | Exit unknown | Supportive so far | + |
| Staffing (Susie) | Unproven | Affordable | + |
| Kitchen permits | 8-16 week delay | Commercial venue | + |

**Overall: Proceed with amendments**

---

### 10. Negotiation Strategy

**Lead with gratitude.** Grant has been generous.

**Frame amendments as "protecting both parties":**
- Clawback = "We want to invest confidently, knowing we're both protected"
- First refusal = "We're building something long-term together"
- Clear definitions = "Avoids disputes down the track"

**Be willing to trade:**
- If Grant resists first refusal → Ask for longer option (3 years instead of 2)
- If Grant resists clawback → Ask for lower base rent
- If Grant wants personal guarantee → Cap it heavily
