## 🎯 The Strategic Question

> **If we go all-in on The Harvest, what does success look like and how do we get there?**

### The Opportunity
The only retail/hospitality space in Witta. A platform to activate ACT Farm, demonstrate our values, and build community—while generating revenue.

### The Risk
Building value in someone else's asset. Operational intensity. Capital lock-up without ownership.

### The Bet
That The Harvest becomes the **shopfront for ACT's mission**—not an end in itself, but a launchpad for everything we're building.
