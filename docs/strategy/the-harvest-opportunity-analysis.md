|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Regenerative** | Garden centre, farm-to-plate, land stewardship | ★★★★★ |

## 4. Resource Requirements

### Critical Roles

| Role | Commitment | Who? | Status |
|------|------------|------|--------|
| **Site Manager** | Full-time on-site | TBD | CRITICAL GAP |
| **Strategic Oversight** | 4 hrs/week | Nic/Ben | Available |
| **Technical/Platform** | As needed | Ben | Constrained (7 codebases) |
| **Garden/Farm Lead** | Part-time | Cath (mentioned) | Pending confirmation |
| **Kitchen/Hospitality** | Part-time/sublease | TBD | Recruit or sublease |

### Capacity Concerns

**Red Flags:**
1. Ben is technical lead across 7 active codebases - bandwidth is limited
2. No dedicated operations person identified
3. Nic's time allocation across projects unclear
4. 112-day gap pattern seen in Goods project - cannot repeat here

**Requirements for Success:**
- Dedicated Site Manager (cannot be Ben or Nic as primary)
- Clear operational leadership from Day 1
- Community coordinator for programming
- Kitchen operator (sublease or hire)

### Recommended Team Structure

```
Strategic Oversight (Nic/Ben) - 4 hrs/week
         │
    Site Manager (NEW HIRE) - Full-time
         │
    ┌────┼────┬────────┐
    │    │    │        │
 Kitchen Garden Events  Makers
 (Sub)  (Cath) (Vol)   (Sub)
```

## 5. Revenue Opportunity

### Short-Term (Year 1)
- **Primary:** Cafe/kitchen operations (52% of revenue)
- **Secondary:** Event space hire, workshops
- **Emerging:** Sublease income, CSA memberships

### Medium-Term (Year 2-3)
- **Scale CSA:** 50-100 members at $60-80/month = $36,000-96,000/year
- **Residency Program:** Artist/maker residencies at $500-1000/week
- **Workshop Revenue:** Cooking classes, gardening, wellness = $40,000+/year
- **Tourism:** Day experiences, farm tours = $20,000+/year

### Long-Term Strategic Value
- **Platform for ACT Farm products** - Direct sales channel
- **Empathy Ledger showcase** - Living demonstration site
- **Social enterprise incubator** - Launch pad for aligned ventures
- **Community ownership model** - Prototype for replication
- **Grant leverage** - Physical site strengthens funding applications

### Revenue by Mission Alignment

| Stream | Revenue Potential | Mission Alignment |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CSA Memberships | High | ★★★★★ |
| Workshop/Education | Medium | ★★★★★ |
| Social Enterprise Sublease | Medium | ★★★★★ |
| Garden Centre | Medium | ★★★★☆ |
| Cafe Operations | High | ★★★☆☆ |
| Event Hire (general) | Medium | ★★☆☆☆ |

**Recommendation:** Prioritize high-alignment revenue streams even if slower to develop.

## 7. Risk Analysis

### High Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **No Site Manager found** | Critical | Medium | Start recruiting NOW, budget for competitive salary |
| **Kitchen permits delayed** | High | Medium | Begin permit process immediately, have backup revenue plan |
| **Ben/Nic bandwidth** | High | High | Strict time boundaries, empower Site Manager |
| **Insufficient capital** | High | Medium | Secure $60K minimum before signing |
| **Weather/seasonal** | Medium | Certain | Plan indoor programming for wet season |

### Medium Risks

## 9. Critical Context: Meeting Notes (Jan 2026)

### Key Insights from Team Discussion

#### Staffing Solution: Susie Arrangement
- **Current:** Susie works at school, $30/hr, $450/week (tuck shop ordering/management, 3 days)
- **Proposed:** Free rent (~$450/week) in exchange for 4 days/week at The Harvest
- **Annual cost:** ~$23K (rent value) vs hiring Site Manager at $60-70K
- **Capability:** Ordering, deli, operational tasks, tuck shop experience
- **Assessment:** This solves the Site Manager gap at 1/3 the cost

#### Grant's Exit Strategy - CRITICAL FLAG
- Grant is "thinking about the entity breaking even"
- May want to "sell it with a fair bit of margin" eventually
- **NOT confirmed as community asset vision**
- **Action Required:** Must clarify before signing - does this align with ACT's "design for obsolescence" mission?

#### Market Positioning - UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY
- "If you look at that whole Witta region, there's no other retail space"
- Filling a genuine gap in the community
- "This starts something quite big that's not currently there"

#### Cost Creep Warning
- Garden development help: $80/hr, 2 days/week = ~$12,800/year
- Need to "optimize value from team members and manage overhead"
- Susie arrangement must deliver real value

#### Renovation-for-Ownership Idea
- Propose paying for some renovations as contribution
- Gain more ownership stake in the property
- Aligns with long-term community asset goal
- Protects ACT investment if Grant later sells

### Updated Decision Framework

| Criteria | Original | Revised | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Mission Alignment | 9/10 | **7/10** | Grant's exit plan unclear - may not be community asset |
| Financial Viability | 6/10 | **7/10** | Susie arrangement improves numbers significantly |
| Resource Availability | 4/10 | **6/10** | Susie solves staffing gap |
| Strategic Value | 8/10 | **9/10** | Only retail in region - unique positioning |
| Risk Level | 5/10 | **5/10** | Exit strategy risk offsets staffing improvement |

| Criteria | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Mission Alignment | 7/10 | 25% | 1.75 |
| Financial Viability | 7/10 | 20% | 1.40 |
| Resource Availability | 6/10 | 25% | 1.50 |
| Strategic Value | 9/10 | 15% | 1.35 |
| Risk Level | 5/10 | 15% | 0.75 |
| **Total** | | | **6.75/10** |

### Recommendation: CONDITIONAL PROCEED

**Proceed IF:**
1. ✅ **Grant clarifies exit vision** - Community asset or commercial sale?
2. ✅ Susie arrangement confirmed (solves Site Manager at $23K vs $60K)
3. ✅ Minimum $40K working capital secured (reduced with Susie)
4. ✅ Cath confirmed for garden centre (watch $80/hr cost creep)
5. ✅ Kitchen permit pathway confirmed with council
6. ✅ Renovation-ownership structure negotiated (protect ACT investment)

**Do Not Proceed IF:**
- Grant confirms commercial sale intent without community pathway
- Susie arrangement falls through AND no alternative staffing
- Capital requirements cannot be met
- Cost estimates show unsustainable burn rate

### Critical Questions for Grant (Before Signing)

1. **"What's your long-term vision for The Harvest?"**
   - Community asset? Commercial investment? Legacy project?

2. **"If you were to sell, would you consider first right of refusal for ACT/community?"**
   - Protects mission alignment

3. **"Would you consider renovation contributions counting toward ownership stake?"**
   - Aligns ACT investment with long-term security

4. **"What does success look like for you in 2-3 years?"**
   - Breaking even? Profitable? Community impact metrics?

### Revised Financial Model (with Susie)

| Item | Original | With Susie | Savings |
|------|----------|------------|---------|
| Site Manager | $60,000 | $23,000 (rent) | $37,000 |
| Total Fixed Costs | $167,600 | $130,600 | $37,000 |
| Break-even Revenue | $14,000/mo | $10,900/mo | Faster |
| Capital Required | $87,000 | $50,000 | $37,000 |

### Immediate Actions

1. **This Week:**
   - **Call Grant** - Ask the four critical questions above
   - Confirm Susie arrangement terms (4 days/week, specific duties)
   - Review garden help costs - can this be reduced or phased?
   - Assess community excitement in Witta region

2. **Next 2 Weeks:**
   - Negotiate renovation-ownership clause in lease
   - Finalize lease with legal review
   - Develop 90-day operational plan with Susie's role defined
   - Create community launch marketing plan

3. **Before Full Commitment:**
   - Grant's vision aligned (or acceptable risk documented)
   - Susie committed and duties clear
   - Insurance in place
   - First 3 months costs covered (~$33K with Susie model)

---

## 10. Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: Full Commitment (Recommended if conditions met)
- Sign lease, hire Site Manager, develop all revenue streams
- Investment: $87K | Expected Return: Break-even Y1, profitable Y2

### Scenario B: Sublease Model
- Sign lease, immediately sublease to aligned cafe operator
- ACT manages strategic programming only (events, CSA, residencies)
- Investment: $30K | Lower risk, lower control, lower mission alignment

### Scenario C: Partnership Model
- Find co-venture partner to share operational burden
- Split revenue and responsibility
- Investment: $45K | Medium risk, shared control

### Scenario D: Decline
- Pass on opportunity
- Focus resources on existing 7 codebases
- Risk: Lose momentum, platform underutilized, landlords find other tenant
