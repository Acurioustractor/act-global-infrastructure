# A Curious Tractor
## First Principles Decision-Making Framework

**Created:** January 2026
**Purpose:** Systematic evaluation of opportunities against mission, resources, and strategic priorities

---

## Part 1: First Principles - Who We Are

### The Core Question
> "Does this make us more like a tractor's PTO - transferring power to communities who then drive their own future? Or does it make us the driver?"

### Mission Statement
**A regenerative innovation ecosystem partnering with marginalised—especially First Nations—communities to dismantle extractive systems.**

### The Tractor Metaphor
Like a tractor's Power Take-Off (PTO):
- We **transfer resources and capacity** to communities
- We **don't drive** - we power what communities choose to build
- We **design for obsolescence** - communities own their narratives, land, and economic futures
- We **hand over the keys** - our success is measured by our irrelevance

### Non-Negotiable Values

| Value | What It Means | Red Flag If... |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Community Ownership** | Communities control assets, decisions, narratives | We own/control the thing long-term |
| **First Nations Priority** | Indigenous partnership in everything | No Indigenous voice in governance |
| **Design for Obsolescence** | Build to hand over, not to hold | We become indispensable |
| **40% Profit Share** | 40% of surplus to community ownership | We extract more than we give |
| **Regenerative** | Restore land, community, systems | We deplete or extract |
| **Joy** | Work that energises, not drains | Team burning out, resentment |

## Part 2: Current Portfolio

### Active Projects (7 Codebases + Farm)

| Project | Stage | Mission Alignment | Resource Intensity | Revenue Potential |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Empathy Ledger** | Growth | ★★★★★ Indigenous storytelling | High (Ben) | Medium (SaaS) |
| **JusticeHub** | Active | ★★★★★ Youth justice, First Nations | Medium | Low (Grant-funded) |
| **Goods** | Stalled? | ★★★★☆ Circular economy | Low (112-day gap) | Medium |
| **ACT Farm** | Foundation | ★★★★★ Regenerative land | Medium | Long-term |
| **The Harvest** | Proposed | ★★★★☆ Community hub | HIGH | Medium |
| **Palm Island** | Active | ★★★★★ Indigenous community | Medium | Grant-funded |
| **ACT Infrastructure** | Ongoing | N/A (Enabling) | High (Ben) | None |

### Team Capacity Reality

| Person | Current Allocation | Available | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| Ben | 7 codebases, technical everything | LOW | Bottleneck risk |
| Nic | Strategy, relationships, The Harvest | MEDIUM | Stretched |
| Susie (proposed) | The Harvest operations | HIGH | New resource |
| Cath (proposed) | Garden centre | MEDIUM | Unconfirmed |

### Financial Reality

| Resource | Amount | Committed | Available |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Operating capital | ? | ? | ? |
| The Harvest commitment | $100K | Proposed | Decision point |
| Grant funding pipeline | ? | ? | ? |
| Revenue (current) | ? | ? | ? |

**⚠️ Critical Gap:** No documented financial position. Cannot make $100K decision without knowing runway.

---

## Part 3: The $100K Question

### Option A: $100K at The Harvest

**What it buys:**
- Lease security (clawback protection)
- Garden centre development
- Commercial kitchen fit-out
- Outdoor space activation
- Community programming launch

**Alignment:**
| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Community ownership | ★★★☆☆ | ACT operates, community benefits, but Grant owns |
| First Nations | ★★★☆☆ | Jinibara Country, but no Indigenous governance yet |
| Design for obsolescence | ★★☆☆☆ | No clear handover path |
| Regenerative | ★★★★☆ | Garden, farm-to-plate, land care |
| Revenue potential | ★★★☆☆ | Medium, requires ongoing effort |
| Joy | ★★★★☆ | Nic/team excited about this |

**Risks:**
- Grant may sell (commercial exit)
- ACT doesn't own the asset
- Operational intensity ongoing
- Ben bandwidth if tech issues
- 13-month lease = short runway to prove viability

**Best case:** Thriving community hub, revenue covers costs, platform for ACT Farm products, replicable model

**Worst case:** $100K gone, lease ends, improvements stay with Grant, team burned out

---

### Option B: $100K at ACT Farm

**What it buys:**
- Infrastructure (water, power, fencing)
- Regeneration works (tree planting, soil restoration)
- Basic accommodation/facilities
- Equipment (actual tractor?)
- Community gathering space on OUR land

**Alignment:**
| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Community ownership | ★★★★★ | ACT owns the land outright |
| First Nations | ★★★★☆ | Jinibara Country, can build Indigenous partnership into governance |
| Design for obsolescence | ★★★★☆ | Can transition to community trust ownership |
| Regenerative | ★★★★★ | 150 acres of regeneration potential |
| Revenue potential | ★★☆☆☆ | Long-term, requires significant development |
| Joy | ★★★☆☆ | Less immediate, more foundational |

**Risks:**
- No immediate revenue
- Longer timeline to activation
- Remote location limits casual visitors
- Requires different skill set (farming, land management)

**Best case:** Regenerated land, Indigenous-led programs, community ownership model, intergenerational asset

**Worst case:** $100K spent on infrastructure that sits underutilised

---

### Option C: $100K Split

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| The Harvest | $50K | Essential improvements only, reduced clawback |
| ACT Farm | $30K | Core infrastructure (water, basic facilities) |
| Reserve | $20K | Operational buffer, opportunities |

**Pros:** Diversified risk, both projects advance
**Cons:** Neither fully resourced, slower progress on both

---

### Option D: Neither - Preserve Capital

**Use $100K for:**
- Operational runway (12+ months)
- Hiring (dedicated ops person across all projects)
- Empathy Ledger growth (revenue-generating)
- Grant matching funds (leverage for larger projects)

**Alignment:**
| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Sustainability | ★★★★★ | Extends runway, reduces pressure |
| Growth | ★★☆☆☆ | Slower, but more stable |
| The Harvest opportunity | ★☆☆☆☆ | Loses the moment |

---

## Part 4: The Harvest ↔ ACT Farm Synergy

### How They Could Work Together

```
ACT Farm (Production)          The Harvest (Distribution)
─────────────────────          ──────────────────────────
Regenerative agriculture  ──→  Farm-to-plate café
Native plant nursery      ──→  Garden centre retail
Education programs        ──→  Workshop venue
Community healing space   ──→  Community gathering hub
Indigenous partnerships   ──→  Cultural programming
Residency accommodation   ──→  Day visitor experience
```

### The "Witta Enterprise" Vision

**Concept:** The Harvest as the **shopfront** for ACT Farm and the broader ACT ecosystem

| ACT Project | The Harvest Connection |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **ACT Farm** | Produce, plants, farm experiences |
| **Empathy Ledger** | Photo displays, storytelling events, Indigenous art |
| **JusticeHub** | Vocational training venue, youth programs |
| **Goods** | Circular economy retail point, refurbished items |
| **Palm Island** | Cultural exchange, visiting artists/makers |

### What "Witta Enterprise" Could Look Like

**Year 1:** The Harvest as community café + event space
- CSA memberships connecting farm and café
- Weekend markets featuring local makers
- Workshop series (cooking, gardening, making)

**Year 2-3:** Integrated ecosystem
- ACT Farm produces → The Harvest sells
- Indigenous artists in residence → exhibitions at The Harvest
- Youth justice programs → hospitality training at The Harvest
- Circular economy hub → Goods products available

**Year 5+:** Community ownership transition
- The Harvest operated by community cooperative
- ACT Farm transitions to Indigenous land trust
- ACT becomes capacity partner, not operator
- Model replicated in other regions

---

## Part 5: Alignment Analysis

### Where The Harvest ALIGNS with ACT Mission

| Alignment | Strength | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Community gathering** | Strong | Fills gap in Witta, community-led programming |
| **Regenerative practices** | Strong | Garden, farm-to-plate, land care values |
| **Social enterprise incubation** | Strong | Micro-providers, makers, local economy |
| **Platform for ACT Farm** | Strong | Distribution channel, visitor pathway |
| **Regional presence** | Strong | Sunshine Coast Hinterland visibility |
| **Revenue generation** | Moderate | Could fund other mission work |

### Where The Harvest MISALIGNS with ACT Mission

| Misalignment | Severity | Concern |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Ownership** | HIGH | Grant owns land - ACT builds value for his exit |
| **Indigenous governance** | MEDIUM | No First Nations partnership in structure yet |
| **Design for obsolescence** | HIGH | No pathway to community ownership of site |
| **Operational intensity** | MEDIUM | Ongoing management vs capacity building |
| **Capital lock-up** | MEDIUM | $100K in improvements ACT doesn't own |
| **Distraction risk** | MEDIUM | Takes focus from Farm and other projects |

### The Core Tension

**ACT's mission:** Build community capacity, then step back
**The Harvest reality:** ACT operates indefinitely as tenant, building value in someone else's asset

**Unless:**
1. Grant commits to community ownership pathway (unlikely based on meeting notes)
2. ACT uses The Harvest as temporary platform while building ACT Farm
3. The Harvest becomes a replicable model that others can own

---

## Part 6: Decision Framework

### The Five Questions

For ANY opportunity, ask:

#### 1. OWNERSHIP: Who owns the asset at the end?

| Answer | Score | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Community/Indigenous ownership | ★★★★★ | Strong yes |
| ACT ownership (transition planned) | ★★★★☆ | Yes with plan |
| ACT ownership (no transition) | ★★☆☆☆ | Caution |
| Third party ownership | ★☆☆☆☆ | Avoid unless strategic |

**The Harvest:** Third party (Grant) → ★☆☆☆☆
**Mitigation:** First right of refusal, time-limited engagement

#### 2. CAPACITY: Does this build community capacity or ACT dependency?

| Answer | Score | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Community runs it, we support | ★★★★★ | Strong yes |
| We run it, training community | ★★★☆☆ | Yes with transition plan |
| We run it indefinitely | ★☆☆☆☆ | Avoid |

**The Harvest:** ACT runs indefinitely (currently) → ★☆☆☆☆
**Mitigation:** Explicit transition plan to community operators

#### 3. INDIGENOUS VOICE: Is First Nations partnership central?

| Answer | Score | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Indigenous-led governance | ★★★★★ | Prioritise |
| Indigenous partnership embedded | ★★★★☆ | Strong yes |
| Indigenous consultation | ★★☆☆☆ | Improve |
| No Indigenous involvement | ★☆☆☆☆ | Reconsider |

**The Harvest:** Jinibara Country, but no governance role yet → ★★☆☆☆
**Mitigation:** Build Indigenous partnership into values framework, programming

#### 4. SUSTAINABILITY: Can this sustain itself without ACT?

| Answer | Score | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Revenue covers costs, surplus shared | ★★★★★ | Ideal |
| Revenue covers costs | ★★★★☆ | Good |
| Requires ongoing ACT subsidy | ★★☆☆☆ | Caution |
| Requires ongoing grant funding | ★★☆☆☆ | Time-limited only |

**The Harvest:** Path to revenue coverage possible → ★★★☆☆
**Mitigation:** Clear financial milestones, exit triggers

#### 5. JOY: Does this energise or drain the team?

| Answer | Score | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Team deeply excited | ★★★★★ | Important signal |
| Team willing | ★★★☆☆ | Proceed carefully |
| Team reluctant | ★★☆☆☆ | Reconsider |
| Team opposed | ★☆☆☆☆ | Don't proceed |

**The Harvest:** Nic excited, Ben supportive → ★★★★☆

---

### The Harvest Scorecard

| Question | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 1. Ownership | ★☆☆☆☆ | Grant owns, commercial exit likely |
| 2. Capacity | ★☆☆☆☆ | ACT operates indefinitely |
| 3. Indigenous Voice | ★★☆☆☆ | Not embedded yet |
| 4. Sustainability | ★★★☆☆ | Possible with execution |
| 5. Joy | ★★★★☆ | Team energy positive |
| **Average** | **2.2/5** | Below threshold |

**Threshold for "Yes":** 3.5/5

**Current Assessment:** DOES NOT MEET THRESHOLD in current form

---

## Part 7: Making The Harvest Work

### What Would Raise the Score?

| Issue | Current | Target | How to Fix |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| Ownership | Grant owns | Community pathway | First refusal + time limit |
| Capacity | ACT operates | Community operates | 3-year transition plan |
| Indigenous | Not embedded | Partnership | Governance role, programming |
| Sustainability | Uncertain | Proven | 12-month milestones |

### The Conditional Yes Framework

**Proceed with The Harvest IF (and only if):**

1. **Ownership Protection**
   - [ ] First right of refusal in lease
   - [ ] OR: Grant commits to community ownership pathway in writing
   - [ ] OR: ACT limits engagement to 3 years maximum

2. **Transition Plan**
   - [ ] Written plan to transition operations to community by Year 3
   - [ ] Identify/develop local operators (Susie? Others?)
   - [ ] Clear milestones for handover

3. **Indigenous Partnership**
   - [ ] Engage Jinibara community before signing
   - [ ] Governance role in programming decisions
   - [ ] Cultural protocols for land use

4. **Financial Guardrails**
   - [ ] $100K recovery protection (clawback clause)
   - [ ] 6-month review points with exit triggers
   - [ ] Break-even by Month 9 or reassess

5. **Farm Integration**
   - [ ] The Harvest explicitly serves ACT Farm strategy
   - [ ] Product/visitor pathway defined
   - [ ] Investment at Farm not delayed by Harvest

### Exit Triggers

**Walk away if:**
- Month 6: Revenue < $8,000/month and no clear path
- Month 9: Not break-even on operating costs
- Month 12: Net loss and team joy declining
- Anytime: Grant indicates imminent sale without first refusal
- Anytime: Significant conflict with community values

---

## Part 8: Recommendation

### The Strategic Choice

| Option | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| A: Full $100K to Harvest | **NO** | Doesn't meet framework threshold |
| B: Full $100K to Farm | **MAYBE** | Better alignment but loses opportunity |
| C: Split $50K/$30K/$20K | **CONSIDER** | Balanced but neither fully resourced |
| D: Preserve capital | **FALLBACK** | If conditions can't be met |

### Recommended Path: CONDITIONAL PROCEED

**Invest in The Harvest IF:**
1. All five "Conditional Yes" criteria can be met
2. Grant agrees to amended lease (v2 draft)
3. Susie confirmed at $26K/year
4. Indigenous engagement initiated before signing
5. ACT Farm $30K allocation preserved

**Structure:**
- The Harvest: $50K maximum (reduced from $100K)
- ACT Farm: $30K for core infrastructure
- Reserve: $20K for operations/opportunities

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Grant conversation (four critical questions)
- Week 2: Indigenous engagement (Jinibara community)
- Week 3: Final decision based on responses
- Week 4: Sign if conditions met, or walk away

### The First Principles Check

> "Does The Harvest make us more like a PTO - powering community capacity? Or does it make us the permanent driver?"

**Current answer:** We become the driver
**Target answer:** We power the community, then hand over the keys

**The gap is closeable** - but only with explicit transition planning, Indigenous partnership, and ownership protection.

---

## Part 9: The Harvest as Strategic Platform

### Reframing the Opportunity

Instead of: "Should we take on The Harvest?"
Ask: "How does The Harvest serve our Farm and mission, with clear boundaries?"

**The Harvest as:**
- **Shopfront** for ACT Farm (not end in itself)
- **Training ground** for community operators (not permanent ACT operation)
- **Revenue generator** for mission work (not profit extraction)
- **Visibility platform** for ACT ecosystem (not standalone project)

### The 3-Year Arc

| Year | The Harvest | ACT Farm | Integration |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Y1** | Launch, prove model | Basic infrastructure | CSA pilot |
| **Y2** | Optimise, train operators | Expand production | Farm supplies Harvest |
| **Y3** | Transition to community | Indigenous partnership deepens | Community owns Harvest model |
| **Y4+** | ACT supports, doesn't operate | Transition to land trust | Replicable model elsewhere |
