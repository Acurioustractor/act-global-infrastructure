# The Harvest Decision - Strategic Advice

**Context:** Curious Tractor reviewed ACT's strategy documents for running The Harvest (retail space in Witta). User requested strategic advice, not technical implementation.

## Decision Summary

| Factor | Score | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Ownership | 1/5 | Building value in Grant's asset |
| Capacity | 1/5 | ACT stretched thin |
| Indigenous Voice | 2/5 | Jinibara not yet engaged |
| Sustainability | 3/5 | Break-even possible |
| Joy | 4/5 | Team wants this |
| **Average** | **2.2/5** | Below 3.5 threshold |

## Strategic Advice

### The Core Question
*"Is this PTO transfer, or is this ACT becoming a retail operator?"*

The framework correctly identified the tension: ACT's mission is to build capacity and step back. The Harvest arrangement has ACT building value indefinitely in someone else's asset.

### My Read

**This is a "proceed with caution" situation, not a "walk away" situation.**

Here's why:
1. **Geographic synergy is real** - Only retail in Witta, adjacent to ACT Farm
2. **Joy score is high (4/5)** - The team wants this, which matters
3. **The risk is structural, not operational** - The problem isn't whether you CAN run it, it's whether you SHOULD

### What I'd Prioritize

**Grant conversation is everything.** The four questions from the framework are correct, but I'd simplify to one:

> "Grant, if this works and The Harvest becomes valuable, what happens? Do you sell to whoever pays most, or would you give us first right?"

His answer tells you everything:
- **"Whoever pays most"** → Walk away. You're building equity for someone else.
- **"I'd want you to have it"** → Proceed with legal protections (first right of refusal, clawback)
- **"I haven't thought about it"** → Help him think about it. His answer after reflection is the real one.

### The Clawback is Non-Negotiable

If you invest $50-100K in renovations and Grant sells to a developer in 3 years, ACT gets nothing. This isn't hypothetical - it's the most likely scenario for a 64-year-old owner of appreciating hinterland property.

**Minimum protection:** Written agreement that if property sells within 5 years, ACT recovers renovation costs (capped at $X) from sale proceeds.

### Jinibara Engagement Reframes Everything

If Jinibara Traditional Owners become partners - even informally - this becomes a different project. It's no longer "ACT runs a cafe" but "ACT facilitates Indigenous-led economic participation in Witta."

That changes:
- Grant funding eligibility
- Community support
- Mission alignment
- Exit strategy (transition to community ownership)

**This should be explored BEFORE signing, not after.**

## Recommended Sequence

```
Week 1: Grant conversation (Nic)
   ↓
   Answer determines path
   ↓
├─ "Commercial sale" → Decline gracefully
│
├─ "Open to protection" →
│     Week 2: Draft term sheet with lawyer
│     Week 2: Jinibara initial outreach
│     Week 3: Financial confirmation ($50K available?)
│     Week 4: Decision point
│
└─ "Undecided" →
      Give Grant a week to think
      Prepare both paths
```

## What Success Looks Like

In 3 years, ONE of these should be true:
1. The Harvest is community-owned (Jinibara, local co-op, or ACT spins it out)
2. ACT has first right to purchase at fair value
3. ACT has exited cleanly with investment recovered

If none of these are possible from the start, don't begin.

---

## The Joy Factor

The framework gave Joy 4/5. Don't underestimate this.

ACT isn't a foundation optimizing for impact metrics. The team's enthusiasm is a real input. But joy without structure leads to burnout and resentment.

**Protect the joy by protecting the mission alignment.**

---

## One More Thing

The framework's "design for obsolescence" test is perfect. Apply it literally:

> "Can I describe, today, how ACT exits The Harvest and hands it to someone else?"

If you can't answer that, you're not ready to proceed.
