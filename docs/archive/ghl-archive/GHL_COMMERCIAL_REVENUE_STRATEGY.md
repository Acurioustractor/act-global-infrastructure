4. **Impact Measurement:** Track social impact alongside revenue (stories amplified, communities supported, policies changed)
5. **Profit Sharing:** 10% of commercial profits reinvested in community programs (grants for storytellers, scholarships for CONTAINED leaders, etc.)

**Commercial Ventures Support Mission:**
- Empathy Ledger SaaS → Sustainable platform for storytellers (not grant-dependent)
- JusticeHub Consulting → Policy change at scale (revenue funds advocacy work)
- AI Consulting → Ethical AI adoption (counters extractive AI)
- ACT Farm → Conservation funding (residency revenue protects land)
- Goods → Circular economy demonstration (not just talk, real products)
