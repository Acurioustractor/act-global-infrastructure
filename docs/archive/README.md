## Why Archive?

Documents are archived when:
1. Setup work is complete (no ongoing action needed)
2. Phase/milestone is finished (historical reference only)
3. Content superseded by newer, leaner documentation
4. One-time checklists have been completed

## Need Something?

If you need to reference archived content:
1. Check if a newer version exists in `/docs/guides/` or `/docs/architecture/`
2. Search the archive folder for the specific document
3. Consider if the content should be updated and moved back to active docs
