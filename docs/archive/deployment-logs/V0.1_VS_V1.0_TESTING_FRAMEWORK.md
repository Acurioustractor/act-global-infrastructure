## 📋 Testing Protocol

### Step 1: Initial Comparison (When Both Complete)

1. **Wait for training completion** (~10-30 min each)
2. **Verify both models are ready**
   - Check: https://platform.openai.com/finetune
   - Confirm: Status = "succeeded"
3. **Test with same 20 queries** (listed above)
4. **Document responses** in comparison table

### Step 2: Response Evaluation

For each query, rate 1-5 on:

**Accuracy (1-5):**
- 5 = Completely accurate, specific details
- 4 = Mostly accurate, minor gaps
- 3 = Generally accurate, some errors
- 2 = Partially accurate, significant errors
- 1 = Inaccurate or hallucinated

**Voice Match (1-5):**
- 5 = Perfect ACT voice, regenerative metaphors, community-centered
- 4 = Strong voice, good metaphors, mostly centered
- 3 = Adequate voice, some metaphors, somewhat centered
- 2 = Weak voice, few metaphors, organization-centered
- 1 = Wrong voice, jargon, extractive framing

**LCAA Application (1-5):**
- 5 = Integrates all relevant LCAA phases naturally
- 4 = Integrates multiple phases well
- 3 = Mentions LCAA, basic integration
- 2 = Limited LCAA reference
- 1 = No LCAA integration

**Overall Quality (1-5):**
- 5 = Excellent, would use publicly
- 4 = Good, minor edits needed
- 3 = Adequate, moderate edits needed
- 2 = Poor, major edits needed
- 1 = Unusable

### Step 3: Aggregate Scoring

Calculate averages for each model:

```
Model Performance = (Accuracy + Voice + LCAA + Overall) / 4
```

**Success Thresholds:**
- 4.0+ = Production-ready
- 3.5-3.9 = Good, needs refinement
- 3.0-3.4 = Adequate, needs work
- < 3.0 = Not ready

### Step 4: Qualitative Analysis

Document:
- **Surprising strengths** - What worked better than expected?
- **Unexpected gaps** - What's still missing?
- **Voice consistency** - Does it sound like ACT?
- **Hallucinations** - Any invented facts?
- **User preference** - Which would you choose for each query?
