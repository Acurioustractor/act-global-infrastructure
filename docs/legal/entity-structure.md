## Entity 1: Sole Trader (WINDING DOWN)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ABN** | 21 591 780 066 |
| **Legal Name** | Marchesi, Nicholas James |
| **Trading As** | A Curious Tractor (registered 01 Oct 2022) |
| **Also Trading As** | Fastforward Productions (registered 07 Mar 2008) |
| **Entity Type** | Individual / Sole Trader |
| **ABN Active From** | 01 October 2007 |
| **GST Registered** | Yes (from 14 January 2022) |
| **Location** | QLD 4006 |

### Wind-Down Plan

The sole trader is the current operating entity. Everything needs to **migrate to the new Pty Ltd** once registered:
- [ ] Transfer contracts and agreements
- [ ] Transfer subscriptions and accounts
- [ ] Transfer grant agreements (notify funders)
- [ ] Update Xero to new entity
- [ ] Cancel or retain ABN (Nic may keep for personal/Fastforward work)
- [ ] Cancel GST registration if ABN retained but not trading

---

## Entity 2: A Kind Tractor LTD (DORMANT / PARKED)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ABN** | 73 669 029 341 |
| **ACN** | 669 029 341 |
| **Legal Name** | A Kind Tractor LTD |
| **Entity Type** | Australian Public Company Limited by Guarantee |
| **Active From** | 21 June 2023 |
| **ACNC Registered** | YES (from 11 December 2023) |
| **GST Registered** | NO |
| **DGR Status** | NO (may apply later) |
| **Status** | **Dormant — not actively operating** |

### Constitution Summary (Dec 2023)

- **Objects:** Advance Health, Social Welfare, Human Rights, Public Debate
- **Directors:** Nic Marchesi (also Secretary), Ben Knight, Jessica Adams
- **Board:** 3-12 directors, quarterly meetings required, 2-year terms

- **Liability:** $10 guarantee per member
- **FY:** 1 July – 30 June

### Keeping AKT Active (Minimum Obligations)

Even dormant, AKT has ASIC/ACNC obligations:

| Obligation | Frequency | Cost | Action |
|-----------|-----------|------|--------|
| ASIC Annual Review | Yearly (~June) | $55 | Must pay to keep registered |
| ACNC Annual Information Statement | Yearly | Free | Must lodge to maintain charity status |
| Director changes | As needed | Free | Notify within 28 days |

> **Decision:** DGR status deferred. May revisit if grant funders require it or if a dedicated charitable arm makes sense later. AKT could serve as the charity vehicle alongside the commercial Pty Ltd in future.

---

## Entity 3: ACT Pty Ltd (TO BE CREATED — PRIORITY)

> This is the **main operating entity**. Everything runs through here.

### What the Pty Ltd Does

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Innovation Studio** | Contract work — consulting, builds, digital projects |
| **JusticeHub** | Digital product — revenue + enabling others to earn |
| **The Harvest** | Lease from philanthropist, make profitable (workshops, gardens, retail, events) |
| **The Farm** | Lease from Nic, R&D + manufacturing + gardens |
| **Goods Marketplace** | Social enterprise marketplace |
| **Empathy Ledger** | Internal storytelling + impact tool (maybe product later) |
| **World Tour 2026** | Field testing EL + JusticeHub, collecting stories |
| **All employment** | Wages, super, contractor payments |

### Registration Steps

| Step | Action | Cost | Provider | Status |
|------|--------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Choose company name** | Free | [ASIC name check](https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx) | [ ] |
| 2 | **Engage accountant** | ~$950-2,500 | See accountant shortlist below | [ ] |
| 3 | **Register company with ASIC** | $576 | Accountant or ASIC direct | [ ] |
| 4 | **Get new ABN** | Free | [ABR](https://www.abr.gov.au/) | [ ] |
| 5 | **Register for GST** | Free | ATO (via ABR) | [ ] |
| 6 | **Open company bank account** | Free/minimal | NAB | [ ] |
| 7 | **Set up Xero** for new entity | N/A | New Xero org or update existing | [ ] |
| 8 | **Register as employer** (if hiring) | Free | ATO | [ ] |
| 9 | **Workers comp insurance** | Varies | <!-- TODO --> | [ ] |
| 10 | **Transfer operations** from sole trader | N/A | See migration checklist below | [ ] |

### Key Decisions

- [x] **Company name:** A Curious Tractor Pty Ltd ✓
- [ ] **Directors:** Ben + Nic? Others?
- [ ] **Shareholders:** Ben + Nic? Equal? Different classes? Trust as shareholder?
- [ ] **Company secretary:** Required — Ben or Nic or external?
- [ ] **Registered office:** Home address or registered agent?
- [ ] **Constitution:** Replaceable rules (free, default) or custom constitution?
- [ ] **Accountant:** See shortlist below

### Accountant Shortlist

> **What we need:** Pty Ltd registration + family trust setup + R&D tax incentive claims + Xero integration + charity compliance (AKT). Prefer: cloud-first, automation-friendly, startup-experienced. We want to do as much as possible ourselves through agentic workflows and AI.

| Firm | Specialty | R&D Tax | Trusts | Xero | NFP/Charity | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| **[Standard Ledger](https://www.standardledger.co/)** | Startup accounting | YES | YES (discretionary + trading trusts) | YES (cloud-first) | Check | Startup-focused for 10+ years. Company + trust setup from $950. ASIC registration included. Best fit for "do it ourselves + support" model. |
| **[Azure Group](https://www.azuregroup.com.au/)** | Tech startup tax | YES (specialist) | YES | YES | Check | "Go-to firm for R&D claims." Offices in Sydney. Strong on cross-border if World Tour has tax implications. |
| **[William Buck](https://williambuck.com/)** | Mid-market advisory | YES | YES | YES | YES (NFP specialist) | Handles trusts, R&D, NFP/charity. More traditional but comprehensive. Brisbane office. |
| **[Pitcher Partners Brisbane](https://www.pitcher.com.au/)** | Middle market | YES | YES | YES | YES | Brisbane-based. Full service: audit, tax, advisory. Strong on business structuring. |
| **[Grant Thornton](https://www.grantthornton.com.au/)** | Innovation incentives | YES (specialist) | YES | YES | YES | Mid-tier, personal touch. Strong R&D tax team. |

**Recommended approach:**
1. Contact **Standard Ledger** first — they're startup-native, cloud-first, handle Pty Ltd + trust setup, and are priced for early-stage companies
2. Ask specifically: "Can you handle R&D tax incentive registration for a mix of software + physical R&D (manufacturing, gardens)?"
3. Ask: "We have a dormant ACNC charity (A Kind Tractor LTD) — can you handle its annual compliance alongside the new Pty Ltd?"
4. Ask: "We want to automate as much bookkeeping as possible through Xero + AI — are you set up for that?"

### Migration Checklist (Sole Trader → Pty Ltd)

| Item | Current Entity | Action | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|--------|
| NAB bank account | Sole trader | Open new Pty Ltd account, redirect payments | [ ] |
| Xero | Sole trader | New org or convert | [ ] |

---

## Entities 4 & 5: Family Trusts (TWO — TO BE CREATED)

> Two family trusts — one for Ben, one for Nic — for tax-efficient payment and asset protection.

### Why Family Trusts?

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Income splitting** | Distribute profits to family members in lower tax brackets |
| **Asset protection** | Trust assets separate from personal liability |
| **Tax planning** | Distribute to adult family members, pay children/spouse for legitimate work |
| **Super contributions** | Can make employer super contributions for family members |
| **Flexibility** | Distributions decided annually based on circumstances |

### Two Trusts

| Trust | Trustee | Beneficiaries | Connects to Pty Ltd |
|-------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Ben's Family Trust** | Ben (or corporate trustee) | Ben, wife, children | Shareholder of Pty Ltd |
| **Nic's Family Trust** | Nic (or corporate trustee) | Nic, family members | Shareholder of Pty Ltd |

### How It Works with the Pty Ltd

```
A Curious Tractor Pty Ltd (operating company)
  ├── Pays wages/salary to Ben (employment — director/operations)
  ├── Pays wages/salary to Nic (employment — director/creative)
  ├── Pays wages to Ben's wife (for legitimate work performed)
  ├── Pays wages to children (for legitimate work performed, age-appropriate)
  ├── Super guarantee (11.5%) for all employed family members
  ├── Distributes profits to Ben's Family Trust (as shareholder)
  │     └── Trust distributes to Ben's family beneficiaries
  │         └── Each taxed at their marginal rate
  └── Distributes profits to Nic's Family Trust (as shareholder)
        └── Trust distributes to Nic's family beneficiaries
            └── Each taxed at their marginal rate
```

### Shareholding Structure Options

| Option | How | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Both trusts as shareholders (50/50)** | Each trust holds 50% of shares | Simple, equal. Dividends split evenly. |
| **Different share classes** | Ordinary shares (voting) + preference shares (dividends) | More flexible but more complex |
| **Unequal split** | e.g., 60/40 or other ratio | Reflects different contributions |

> **Accountant to advise** on the optimal shareholding structure.

### Family Member Roles (must be legitimate work)

| Person | Potential Role | Legitimate Work Examples |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| Ben | Director, operations, development | Full-time management, software development, strategy |
| Nic | Director, creative, community | Creative direction, community engagement, storytelling |
| Ben's wife | <!-- Name? Role? --> | Admin, bookkeeping, event coordination, community liaison, content |
| Ben's children | Junior assistants | Age-appropriate: filing, data entry, event help, content creation, testing |
| Nic's family | <!-- Roles? --> | <!-- Legitimate work examples --> |

> **ATO scrutiny:** Family member payments must be for **actual work performed** at **market rates**. Keep timesheets/records. Children's pay must be age-appropriate and reasonable. The ATO actively reviews trust distributions and family employment arrangements (PCG 2021/4 now fully in effect).

### Trust Setup Steps (x2 — one for each trust)

| Step | Action | Cost (each) | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Engage accountant to advise on structure | Part of Pty Ltd setup | [ ] |
| 2 | Draft trust deed | ~$1,000-2,500 | [ ] |
| 3 | Appoint trustee (individual or corporate) | Varies | [ ] |
| 4 | Get TFN for trust | Free | [ ] |
| 5 | Get ABN for trust (if trading) | Free | [ ] |
| 6 | Open trust bank account | Free/minimal | [ ] |
| 7 | Set up trust in Xero (if needed) | N/A | [ ] |

### Key Decisions

- [ ] **Trust type:** Discretionary (family) trust is standard for both
- [ ] **Trustees:** Individual (Ben/Nic) or corporate trustee for each?
- [ ] **Ben's beneficiaries:** Ben, wife, children, future children?
- [ ] **Nic's beneficiaries:** Nic, family members?
- [ ] **Shareholding split:** 50/50? Other ratio?
- [ ] **Share classes:** Ordinary only, or ordinary + preference?
- [ ] **Accountant:** Same firm handles all (Pty Ltd + both trusts)

|--------|--------|------|--------|------------------|
| **Innovation Studio contracts** | Pty Ltd | Consulting / builds | Active | <!-- TODO --> |

## R&D Tax Incentive

> The new Pty Ltd will be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. For companies with turnover under $20M, the refundable offset is **18.5% above the company tax rate** (i.e., 25% + 18.5% = 43.5% effective rate, or up to 48.5% depending on structure). The offset calculation changed in recent years — an R&D consultant will confirm the exact rate for ACT's situation.

### R&D Activities to Track

| Activity | Category | Location | Annual Spend |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Empathy Ledger** | Core R&D — novel data sovereignty + storytelling platform | Digital + World Tour | <!-- TODO --> |
| **JusticeHub** | Core R&D — novel digital justice platform | Digital | <!-- TODO --> |
| **Goods Marketplace** | Supporting R&D — social enterprise marketplace tech | Digital + Harvest | <!-- TODO --> |
| **World Tour 2026** | Core R&D — field testing EL + JH in real communities | International | <!-- TODO --> |
| **Farm R&D** | Supporting R&D — manufacturing methods, garden tech, workshop innovation | The Farm | <!-- TODO --> |
| **ALMA measurement** | Core R&D — novel impact measurement methodology | Digital | <!-- TODO --> |
| **LCAA framework** | Core R&D — novel community engagement methodology | Digital + Field | <!-- TODO --> |
| **Agentic system** | Supporting R&D — AI agent orchestration + memory | Digital | <!-- TODO --> |

### R&D Value

```
For Pty Ltd with turnover < $20M:
  Refundable tax offset = company tax rate + 18.5% of eligible R&D expenditure
  For base rate entity (25% tax rate): effective offset = 43.5%
  Note: Up to 48.5% possible depending on structure

Example at 43.5%:
  $100K eligible R&D spend → $43,500 cash refund
  $200K eligible R&D spend → $87,000 cash refund
  $300K eligible R&D spend → $130,500 cash refund

Important: R&D activities must be registered with DISR (Department of Industry)
           within 10 months of FY end (by 30 April for June FY companies)
           Expenditure threshold: up to $150M
           New application form mandatory from FY25 onwards
```

### R&D Registration Steps

| Step | Action | When | Status |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | Register Pty Ltd | ASAP | [ ] |
| 2 | Engage R&D tax consultant | After Pty Ltd registered | [ ] |
| 3 | Start documenting ALL R&D activities | NOW | [ ] |
| 4 | Register with AusIndustry | Within 10 months of FY end | [ ] |
| 5 | Lodge R&D tax schedule | With company tax return | [ ] |

### Documentation Requirements (Start Now)

Even before the Pty Ltd is registered, **start documenting everything**:

- [ ] Technical challenges being solved (what's novel?)
- [ ] Hypotheses tested and outcomes
- [ ] Time logs for R&D activities (who did what, how long)
- [ ] Third-party costs (cloud, APIs, tools, travel) attributable to R&D
- [ ] Git commit history (evidence of systematic experimentation)
- [ ] World Tour itinerary and R&D objectives per location
- [ ] Farm experiments and manufacturing prototypes
- [ ] Workshop methodology development notes

### R&D Consultant

Look for consultants who specialize in software + physical R&D claims:
- Typically charge 10-15% of claim value (success-based)
- Ask: "Have you done software/SaaS R&D claims before?"
- Ask: "Can we claim physical R&D (manufacturing, gardens) alongside digital?"
- Ask: "Can we claim international R&D activities (world tour)?"

## Wages, Super & Tax-Efficient Payments

### Employment Structure (via Pty Ltd)

| Person | Role | Employment Type | Salary/Wage | Super (11.5%) | Notes |
|--------|------|----------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Ben Knight | Director / Operations | Full-time employee | <!-- TODO --> | Yes | Market rate |
| Ben's wife | <!-- Role --> | Part-time / casual | <!-- TODO --> | Yes (if > $450/month) | Must be legitimate work |
| Children | Junior assistants | Casual (age-appropriate) | <!-- TODO --> | If eligible | Must be real work at fair rate |

### Super Obligations

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Rate | 11.5% (2025-26), rising to 12% from 1 Jul 2025 |
| Due | 28th of month following quarter end |
| Threshold | Super guarantee now applies from first dollar (no $450/month threshold from Jul 2024) |
| STP | Single Touch Payroll required for all employees |
| Fund | Default fund or employee choice |

### Family Trust Distribution

```
Pty Ltd profits
  → Dividend to Family Trust (shareholder)
  → Trustee decides annual distribution
  → Distribute to beneficiaries based on:
     - Income needs
     - Marginal tax rates
     - Legitimate contributions to the business
```

### Key Tax Considerations

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Company tax rate** | 25% (base rate entity, turnover < $50M) |
| **Division 7A** | Loans from Pty Ltd to trust/individuals must comply — get accountant advice |
| **Reasonable salary** | ATO expects directors to draw reasonable salary, not just dividends |
| **Children's income** | Unearned income (trust distributions) to under-18s taxed at top rate — must be EARNED |
| **Wife's work** | Must be genuine, documented, at market rates |
| **Farm lease** | Nic→Pty Ltd lease = deductible expense for company, rental income for Nic |

> **Critical:** The accountant setting up the Pty Ltd should also design the trust and payment structure. Getting this wrong with the ATO is expensive.
