openai api fine_tunes.create \
  -t training-data/act-voice-training-dataset-v2-2026-01-01.jsonl \
  -m gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 \
  --suffix "act-voice-v0.1" \
  --n_epochs 3

# 4. Monitor progress
openai api fine_tunes.follow -i ft-xxxxx

# 5. Use model when ready
# Model ID: gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:act-voice-v0.1
```

### Option 3: OpenAI Dashboard (UI)

## 🧪 Testing v0.1

### Test Queries (Compare vs. Base Model)

Test these questions with both base GPT-4o-mini and your fine-tuned v0.1:

#### 1. LCAA Methodology
```
Q: What does Listen mean in ACT's LCAA methodology?

Expected: Detailed explanation of Listen as deep, patient listening to place, people, history, and community voice. Should mention listening to Country, Traditional Owners, Community, Elders, Youth, and the Silenced.

Base model: Generic answer about listening
Fine-tuned: ACT-specific Listen methodology
```

#### 2. Project-Specific Knowledge
```
Q: How did Curiosity shape the Empathy Ledger platform?

Expected: Specific questions explored (What if stories had consent like FPIC?), prototyping experiments, what was learned, pivots made.

Base model: Generic or invented answer
Fine-tuned: Specific ACT Empathy Ledger Curiosity journey
```

#### 3. Strategic Pillars
```
Q: How does ACT's Circular Economy work connect to LCAA?

Expected: Goods on Country example showing Listen (beds as need) → Curiosity (can waste become wealth?) → Action (manufacturing) → Art (beds as transformation)

Base model: Generic circular economy concepts
Fine-tuned: ACT-specific Goods on Country + LCAA integration
```

#### 4. Voice & Tone
```
Q: Tell me about ACT's approach to community partnerships

Expected:
- Community-centered language
- References to power transfer, not control
- Mentions 40% profit-sharing, designed obsolescence
- Humble tone ("we're learning as we go")
- LCAA methodology application

Base model: Generic partnership advice
Fine-tuned: ACT voice, values, and specific practices
```

#### 5. Cultural Protocols
```
Q: How does ACT listen to Elders in the Listen phase?

Expected: Cultural protocol details, Elder review workflows, consent processes, payment/reciprocity, relationship over transaction

Base model: Generic respect for elders
Fine-tuned: Specific ACT practices and protocols
```

## 📊 A/B Testing Framework

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Base Model | v0.1 Fine-Tuned | v1.0 Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** (factual correctness) | Baseline | Measure | +30% |
| **Voice Match** (sounds like ACT) | Baseline | Measure | +50% |
| **LCAA Application** (uses methodology) | Baseline | Measure | +80% |
| **Project Knowledge** (specific details) | Baseline | Measure | +90% |
| **Cultural Sensitivity** (protocols respected) | Baseline | Measure | +70% |

### Testing Process

1. **Blind Testing:**
   - Give evaluators responses from both models (unlabeled)
   - Ask: "Which sounds more like ACT?"
   - Track preference rates

2. **Accuracy Scoring:**
   - 20 factual questions about ACT projects
   - Score: Correct / Partially Correct / Incorrect
   - Compare base vs. fine-tuned

3. **Voice Evaluation:**
   - Rate each response on ACT voice characteristics:
     - Community-centered (1-5)
     - Uses LCAA language (1-5)
     - Regenerative metaphors (1-5)
     - Humble/honest tone (1-5)
     - Anti-jargon (1-5)

4. **User Feedback:**
   - Internal team uses both models
   - Gather qualitative feedback
   - Identify gaps for v1.0

## 🎯 v0.1 Goals & Expectations

### What v0.1 Should Do Well ✅
- Explain LCAA methodology (Listen, Curiosity especially strong)
- Describe major projects (Empathy Ledger, JusticeHub, Goods on Country, BCV, The Harvest)
- Use ACT voice and tone (community-centered, humble)
- Apply strategic pillars to real examples
- Respect cultural protocols and sovereignty principles

### What v0.1 May Struggle With ⚠️
- Art phase details (only 14 examples - 28% of target)
- Art of Social Impact pillar (not covered in training)
- Regenerative metaphors (only 27.8% coverage)
- Very specific Art installation details
- Recent updates not in training data (Dec 2024 cutoff)

### Known Limitations
- Training data from Dec 2024 (may not reflect 2026 updates)
- Art phase under-represented
- No real user queries yet (all synthetic examples)
- May overfit to training examples

---

## 📈 Success Criteria for v0.1

Deploy v0.1 as successful if it achieves:

- ✅ **70%+ voice match** (sounds like ACT in blind tests)
- ✅ **80%+ factual accuracy** (correct project details)
- ✅ **60%+ LCAA application** (uses methodology appropriately)
- ✅ **No cultural protocol violations** (zero incidents)
- ✅ **Positive internal feedback** (team prefers vs. base model)

If v0.1 meets these criteria → Proceed to v1.0 with improvements

If v0.1 underperforms → Analyze gaps, add training data, retrain

## 💾 Model Information (Post-Deployment)

After deployment, save this information:

```json
{
  "version": "v0.1",
  "modelId": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:act-voice-v0.1",

}
```

Save to: `training-data/act-voice-model-v0.1-info.json`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Fine-tuning Job Fails
- **Error: Invalid format**
  - Check JSONL format: each line must be valid JSON
  - Validate: `node scripts/analyze-training-dataset.mjs training-data/act-voice-training-dataset-v2-2026-01-01.jsonl`

- **Error: Too few examples**
  - OpenAI requires minimum 10 examples
  - v0.1 has 90 ✅

- **Error: Token limit exceeded**
  - Check max tokens per example
  - v0.1 max: 559 tokens (well below 4096 limit) ✅

### Model Doesn't Improve Over Base
- **Possible causes:**
  - Training data not diverse enough
  - Not enough examples for specific topics
  - Overfitting to training examples

- **Solutions:**
  - Test with queries not in training data
  - Add more diverse examples in v1.0
  - Check if epochs should be reduced (currently 3)

### Model Hallucinates or Invents
- **Possible causes:**
  - Trying to answer questions outside training
  - Filling gaps with base model knowledge

- **Solutions:**
  - Add system message: "Only answer based on ACT knowledge. Say 'I don't have that specific information' if unsure."
  - Add examples of saying "I don't know"
  - Test with out-of-domain questions
