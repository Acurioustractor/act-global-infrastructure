1. Core Art definition in LCAA
2. The Gold.Phone (connection across difference)
3. The Confessional (anonymous truth-telling)
4. The Treacher (Country as teacher)
5. Art integration throughout projects
6. Artist residencies at BCV
7. Art as provocation
8. Storytelling as art methodology

**Art Practice & Philosophy (11 examples):**

10. Community co-creation
11. Art of Social Impact pillar ← Completes 100% coverage!
12. Art + Listen phase connection
13. Art + Curiosity phase connection
14. Art + Action phase connection
15. Photography and documentation
16. Writing and language as art
17. Land art at BCV
18. Performance art
19. Beauty's role in transformation

**Art & Impact (11 examples):**
20. Art communicating complex systems change
21. Art as methodology vs. outcome
22. Art as revolution philosophy
23. Art + Traditional Owner wisdom
24. Measuring art's impact
25. Future art projects
26. Art building movement and identity
27. Art bearing witness to transformation
28. Regenerative metaphors throughout work
29. Art making work accessible vs. academic
30. Regenerative art practice

### Voice Enhancement Throughout

Every Art example includes:
- ✅ Regenerative metaphors (seeds, soil, cultivation, harvest, roots, growth)
- ✅ Nature-based language (gardens, forests, seasons, ecosystems)
- ✅ Community-centered framing
- ✅ LCAA integration
- ✅ Cultural respect and protocols

**Result:** Regenerative metaphor usage increased from 27.8% (v0.1) to 45.8% (v1.0)

## 🆚 v0.1 vs v1.0 Comparison

### When to Use v0.1
- **Immediate testing** (already training)
- **Baseline comparison** (what does 90 examples achieve?)
- **Art-light applications** (when Art phase less critical)
- **Budget testing** (smaller, cheaper to train)

### When to Use v1.0
- **Production deployment** (higher quality)
- **Complete LCAA coverage** (all phases well-represented)
- **Art-heavy applications** (installations, creative work, consciousness-shifting)
- **Maximum quality** (96/100 vs 88/100)
- **100% pillar coverage** (all strategic pillars)

### A/B Testing Plan

Test both models with same queries:

**Test Categories:**
1. LCAA methodology questions
2. Project-specific knowledge
3. Art and creative systems change
4. Voice and tone match
5. Strategic pillar integration

**Expected Results:**
- v0.1: Strong on Listen, Curiosity, Action; weaker on Art
- v1.0: Strong across all LCAA phases + enhanced voice
- v1.0 should outperform on: Art questions, regenerative language, complete answers
