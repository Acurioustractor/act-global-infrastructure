# Essay Review and Promotion Recommendations

*Review of all 8 drafts in thoughts/writing/drafts/ — which have energy, which should move to in-progress, and which need rethinking.*

---

## Tier 1: Ready for In-Progress

These have genuine voice, clear argument, and connect deeply to ACT's philosophy. They need refinement but the core is strong.

### "Obsolescence as Liberation: The ACT Methodology of Regenerative Engagement"
- **Project:** Goods on Country (tagged) but really about ACT's core methodology
- **Strength:** The LCAA framework explanation is the clearest articulation anywhere. The four-stage regenerative engagement model (Initial Engagement → Capacity Development → Systematic Withdrawal → Ongoing Reflection) is powerful and original.
- **Needs:** The title says "Goods on Country" in the project tag but this is much bigger — it's ACT's methodology essay. Retag as ACT-wide. Could be the defining piece that explains what ACT is to outsiders.
- **Recommendation:** **Move to in-progress.** This is the essay.

### "Systems, Scale, and Meaningful Participation"
- **Project:** JusticeHub
- **Strength:** The "Architecture of Participation" framing is compelling. The 10-year lens insight — when people see themselves as part of a generative long-term transformation, engagement shifts from transactional to transformational — is genuinely insightful.
- **Needs:** More specificity. Ground the abstractions in real JusticeHub or PICC examples. What does "meaningful participation" look like for a young person in the justice system? For an Elder on Palm Island?
- **Recommendation:** **Move to in-progress.** Add concrete ACT examples to ground the philosophy.

## Tier 2: Good Bones, Needs Work

These have useful content but need reshaping or merging.

### "On Country Goods - Community Manufacturing Model"
- **Project:** Goods on Country
- **Strength:** The "bed as metaphor" section is evocative. The vision of community manufacturing hubs is compelling.
- **Needs:** More concrete detail. Who? Where? What does a pilot look like? The decision framework shows Goods has been stalled for 112+ days — this essay could be the re-engagement tool if grounded in specifics.
- **Recommendation:** Keep in drafts. Revisit when Maddi conversation happens.

### "Collective Impact and Community Engagement"
- **Project:** Empathy Ledger
- **Strength:** The "Indigenous kinship models of collective contribution" thread is important and underexplored.
- **Needs:** Currently reads as a set of provocations without a through-line. Could become powerful if it takes one of those provocations — "How can we build systems that genuinely celebrate all forms of community action?" — and answers it through the Empathy Ledger lens.
- **Recommendation:** Keep in drafts. Merge the strongest insights into the Obsolescence essay or develop as its own piece when Empathy Ledger licensing conversations begin.

### "Systems, Scale, and Supportive Organizational Design"
- **Project:** JusticeHub
- **Strength:** "Organizational systems are living ecosystems that either constrain or liberate human potential" — strong line.
- **Needs:** Very similar to "Meaningful Participation" — consider merging. This version leans more toward org design, the other toward community participation. Together they'd be stronger than apart.
- **Recommendation:** **Merge into "Meaningful Participation"** and archive this one.

## Tier 3: Early Stage / Specific Purpose

These serve a function but aren't essays — they're pitches or concept notes.

### "On-Country Production Framework - Community Opportunity Pitch"
- **Project:** Goods on Country
- **What it is:** A pitch document for the bed manufacturing initiative in Central Australia and Townsville.
- **Recommendation:** Keep as-is in drafts. Useful as a pitch template when Goods reactivates. Not an essay — it's a tool.

### "Parmon Production Initiative Pitch"
- **Project:** Goods on Country
- **What it is:** Nearly identical to the above. Same pitch, slightly different framing.
- **Recommendation:** **Merge with the other pitch** or delete one. Having two near-identical documents creates confusion. Note: "Parmon" in the title appears to be a voice-to-text artefact — the renamed files say "On-Country" which is correct.

### "Collective Potential Platform at The Harvest"
- **Project:** ACT-HV
- **What it is:** Early concept note for a collaborative platform at The Harvest.
- **Needs:** The decision framework and yearly goals have overtaken this. The "Collective Potential Platform" concept could fold into the Harvest operational plan rather than living as a standalone essay.
- **Recommendation:** Keep in drafts as reference. Content is useful but it's a planning artefact, not a writing piece.
