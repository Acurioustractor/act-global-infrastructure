# Parmon Production Initiative: Community Opportunity Framework

## Vision
Create a sustainable manufacturing ecosystem that provides meaningful employment and skill development for young people, particularly those at risk of or impacted by the youth justice system.

## The Opportunity

- **Location**: Central Australia and Townsville

## Key Components
### Manufacturing Capability

- Skill transfer and apprenticeship model
- Sustainable manufacturing practices

### Youth Employment Pathway
- Structured training programs
- Mentorship opportunities
- Real-world manufacturing skills
- Pathway out of systemic disadvantage

## Our Approach
- Community-driven design

- Measurable impact defined by community, not external metrics

## Next Steps
- Develop detailed production framework
- Identify initial training and employment cohort
- Build partnership network

## Why This Matters
This is more than a manufacturing initiative. It's about creating genuine opportunities, supporting young people's aspirations, and building economic pathways that respect community agency and potential.
