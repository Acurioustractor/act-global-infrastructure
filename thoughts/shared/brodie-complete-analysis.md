# Brodie Germaine — Complete Communication Analysis
**Prepared for ACT (A Curious Tractor) — Business Manager Support Assessment**
**Data sources: 437 emails (Jan 2024 – Feb 2026) + 1,933 iMessages (Sept 2023 – Feb 2026) + Full Notion project review (38 Actions, 3 Opportunities, 7 Resources, sub-pages) + YDPF grant application (14pp) + Budget reconciliation + Kickstarter application + Campfire website codebase**

## Executive Summary

Brodie Germaine is a First Nations personal trainer and community leader based in Mount Isa, Queensland, operating Brodie Germaine Fitness Aboriginal Corporation (ICN 10049). Over 28 months of close engagement with ACT's Benjamin Knight, he has built a genuinely impactful youth justice and cultural connection program — the BAIL and CAMPFIRE programs — that is now funded at nearly **$500,000** across multiple active grants. He has won national recognition through the AMP Tomorrow Makers People's Choice Award, secured a $277,500 Queensland Government contract, and is delivering measurable outcomes to 15–18 young people weekly and communities across the Lower Gulf region. By any program delivery measure, he is succeeding.

The challenge ACT faces is in equal measure: behind the community impact sits a compliance situation that is now genuinely at risk. At least three acquittals are overdue or in progress simultaneously. His corporation has not lodged two consecutive years of ORIC annual reports — risking prosecution. He has been operating without systematic financial records for over two years. His ABN is not GST-registered. These are not minor administrative omissions; they are structural vulnerabilities that could jeopardise funding relationships with government departments already demonstrating patience.

The communication data, both formal and informal, paints a coherent picture: Brodie is enthusiastic, warm, and highly responsive when engaged — but he does not self-sustain. BK has been the operational engine, initiating 62.5% of conversations and absorbing much of the administrative burden. This is not sustainable and must change. The good news is that February 2026 represents a genuine maturation moment: Brodie is self-initiating, submitting financial data proactively, and identifying operational gaps himself. The groundwork for a capable, self-managing operator is present. A well-designed business manager engagement — voice-first, structured, specific, and relationship-based — can unlock it.

ACT's job is to replace BK as the operational driver, complete the compliance backlog, install basic systems, and gradually hand Brodie the reins. Done right, the relationship that BK has built — genuine, warm, trust-based, and spanning nearly 2,000 conversations — is the most powerful asset in this engagement.

**UPDATE (Feb 2026):** Full Notion review reveals $499k total funding (up from $400k), Kickstarter compliance docs NOT STARTED ($140k blocked), and a new grant (Kickstarter) with mandatory SRS reporting. The JusticeHub platform is being designed to provide the agentic backend support Brodie needs — see Section 11.

## 4. COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### The Voice-First Relationship (iMessage Data)

The single most important structural finding from 1,933 iMessages is this: **99.85% of all messages have no text content**. Of 1,933 messages, approximately 1,817 are voice memos and 113 are images or document attachments. Only two text messages exist in the entire 28-month dataset — both sent by Brodie on 19 February 2026.

This is not a texting relationship. This is a **voice memo relationship**. BK and Brodie communicate almost exclusively through short audio messages sent via iMessage. The implications for how ACT designs Brodie's support are significant: he does not absorb information through written documentation; he processes through listening and speaking. Any system built around email instructions, written reports, or portal form-filling will fight against his natural communication modality.

### Email Patterns (437 Emails — Formal Channel, Third Parties Involved)

The email record covers January 2024 to February 2026 and represents Brodie's formal operational footprint — correspondence with government departments, grant bodies, program partners, and ACT itself. Key structural features:

- The email channel is primarily BK-managed: BK drafts correspondence, submits forms, manages portals, and fields overdue notices on Brodie's behalf
- Brodie's own email contributions are typically forwarding documents (receipts, ORIC notices, grant updates) to BK with brief requests for help
- A clear pattern of reactive behaviour: Brodie initiates contact in the email channel most frequently when something overdue or urgent has landed in his inbox
- His business email (`bgermaine@gidgeehealing.com`) appeared in late 2024, using his employer's domain — corporate email transition to a BG Fit address still in progress as at late 2025

### iMessage Patterns (1,933 Voice Memos — Informal Channel, BK and Brodie Only)

**Volume over time:**

| Period | Messages | Notable |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Q4 2023 | 209 | Establishment phase |
| Q1–Q2 2024 | 568 | Peak engagement |
| Q3–Q4 2024 | 343 | Cooling, with sharp Nov 2024 collapse |
| Q1–Q2 2025 | 388 | Recovery |
| Q3–Q4 2025 | 375 | Steady; Nov 2025 Brodie-led surge |
| Q1 2026 | 49 | Jan–Feb, active |

**Initiation patterns:**
- BK initiates **62.5%** of new conversations (222 vs 133 Brodie-initiated, defined as 4+ hour gaps)
- BK accounts for **54.8%** of total messages (1,059 of 1,933)
- BK breaks silence after **18 of 29** significant gaps (7+ days); Brodie breaks only 11
- However, Brodie broke the two longest gaps: after the Dec 2024–Jan 2025 gap (29 days), Brodie came back first on 13 January 2025; and after the December 2025 silence, Brodie re-engaged first

**Response times:**

| | BK responding to Brodie | Brodie responding to BK |
|--|--|--|
| Median response time | 3.7 minutes | 6.6 minutes |
| Under 5 min | 54% | 47% |
| Under 30 min | 74% | 74% |

Both parties respond quickly and symmetrically — 74% of exchanges resolve within 30 minutes on both sides. This is a highly responsive relationship. Brodie is not avoiding BK; he is fast to respond when in an active period.

### Growing Independence Trend

A clear and positive trend in the data: in the early period (2023–2024), BK's initiation dominance was near-total. By late 2025 and into 2026, Brodie is leading more often. **November 2025 is the first month in the dataset where Brodie's message count (64) exceeds BK's (54)** — a structural first. The February 2026 texts, where Brodie proactively updates BK on financial reporting and flags an operational gap he has identified himself, represent the most self-directed behaviour in the 28-month record.

### Notion Action Items — Current Status (from Feb 2026 review)

**In Progress / Please Water:**
- Set up Xero and org email — In progress
- Overall Budget (consolidated view) — Please water
- BG Fit website — Please water
- CAMPFIRE Project Schedule & Progress Tracking — In progress

**Not Started (CRITICAL):**
- Kickstarter key docs (child safety, risk management, disputes, complaints) — blocks $140k
- Police report November 25
- BG Fit November Session follow-ups

## 5. STRENGTHS — What Brodie Does Well

### Community Delivery (Email Evidence)

Brodie is delivering on the ground ahead of funding certainty. BK's April 2025 program update captures this:

> *"We went ahead and rolled out the first camp as interest was so high and took the time to engage with youth week activities, spend time with Elders and create some stories."*

He ran the first Camping on Country event before YDPF funding was fully processed. He ran a community BBQ in Doomadgee with 150+ youth and community members. He is consistently providing mentoring, fitness training, and cultural connections to 15–18 young people weekly. The core work — the reason the programs exist — is happening, and happening well.

### Relationship Building (Email Evidence)

Brodie has deep, trusted relationships with Traditional Owners and community Elders across multiple communities in the Lower Gulf region. He secured verbal consent from community leaders across Doomadgee, Burketown, Normanton, and Gregory for support letters. He has established referral pathways from flexi schools, youth justice contacts, and community health services. BK described this in November 2025 as Brodie having set up "an amazing set of referral pathways and links to young people."

### Responsiveness When Engaged (iMessage Evidence)

When in an active period, Brodie responds within a 6.6-minute median — faster than most professional contacts. He clearly has his phone on him and is comfortable picking up voice memos quickly. He is not avoiding the channel and not difficult to reach. His responsiveness is a strength that can be built upon: any system that reaches him via voice will get fast pickup.

### Growing Operational Maturity (iMessage Evidence)

The November 2025 shift where Brodie out-messaged BK for the first time, and the February 2026 texts where he proactively submits financial data and identifies a referral process gap, represent genuine maturation. His affect in those messages — *"Smashing through it"* — signals that when pointed at an administrative task with direction and momentum, he engages with real energy, not reluctance.

### National Recognition (AMP Award)

Being accepted into the AMP Foundation Tomorrow Makers fellowship is highly competitive. Winning the People's Choice Award among social enterprise leaders is a signal that his work resonates beyond Mount Isa. This is a credibility asset for future funding applications and partnership development that ACT should actively leverage.

## 11. JUSTICEHUB BACKEND — AGENTIC SUPPORT ARCHITECTURE

### Design Philosophy

The entire communication analysis points to one truth: **Brodie communicates through voice and relationships, not forms and portals.** Any backend system must be designed around this reality. JusticeHub's role is not to make Brodie into an administrator — it's to be the administrator for him, transforming his natural outputs (voice memos, photos, community encounters) into the structured data funders require.

The system should feel like **a trusted team member who never forgets**, not a compliance portal. It should make Brodie feel connected to his work, able to communicate what he does, and confident showing impact — without requiring him to change who he is.

### Core Principle: Voice-In, Structure-Out

Everything enters the system the way Brodie naturally communicates:
- **Voice memo** → transcribed → parsed into structured data (attendance, receipts, referrals, milestones)
- **Photo from phone** → tagged with session/event → becomes content for social media, funder reports, grant applications
- **Quick tap on phone** → check-in for session attendance, receipt capture, referral logging

Everything leaves the system in the format funders and partners need:
- **YDPF report** auto-generated from attendance + budget data
- **SRS export** formatted for Kickstarter quarterly submission
- **Compliance dashboard** showing what's submitted, what's pending, what's overdue
- **Impact story** woven from Empathy Ledger storytelling + attendance data + milestone tracking

### Agentic Workflows

#### 1. Voice Memo Agent ("The Listener")
**Trigger**: Brodie sends a voice memo via WhatsApp/iMessage/app
**Process**:
1. Transcribe using Whisper/Deepgram
2. AI classifies content: session update? receipt info? referral? general chat?
3. Route to appropriate handler:
   - Session update → create/update `org_sessions` + prompt for attendance count
   - Receipt info → create `grant_transactions` + extract amount/supplier/category
   - New referral → create `org_referrals` + notify partner agency
   - Milestone → create `org_milestones` for participant
   - General update → store as note, flag anything actionable
4. Send Brodie a brief voice summary back: "Got it — logged 12 attendees at today's gym session, $285 receipt from Sports Power matched to Sporting Goods budget line. You've got $2,215 left on that line."

#### 2. Weekly Pulse Agent ("The Nudger")
**Trigger**: Monday 8am
**Process**:
1. Check all active grants for upcoming deadlines (reports, compliance, payments)
2. Check attendance data gaps (sessions without attendance logged)
3. Check budget burndown for any overspend alerts
4. Generate a 60-second voice briefing (TTS):
   - "Hey Brodie, quick Monday update. Three things this week: One, your Kickstarter quarterly is due in 12 days — I've got most of it drafted, just need your session count for Doomadgee. Two, you've got $331 left from YDPF — don't spend anything else on that one. Three, there's a new QLD youth justice grant closing March 15 that you'd be perfect for. Have a great week brother."
5. Send via WhatsApp or push notification

#### 3. Funder Report Agent ("The Translator")
**Trigger**: Report deadline approaching (14 days before)
**Process**:
1. Pull all attendance, milestones, budget data for the reporting period
2. Match to funder's report format (YDPF final report Q1-Q15, Kickstarter SRS, QLD Gives acquittal)
3. Auto-fill every field that can be calculated from data
4. Highlight gaps in yellow (fields that need Brodie's input)
5. Generate draft narrative from:
   - Attendance trends + milestone data
   - Community voice quotes from `org_stories`
   - Photos from `org_content`
   - Budget reconciliation from `grant_transactions`
6. Send to Brodie as a voice briefing: "Your YDPF report is 80% done. I need three things from you: how many female vs male participants, your honest estimate on re-offending rate, and one case study of a young person. Send me a voice memo with those and I'll submit it."

#### 4. Profile & Share Agent ("The Amplifier")
**Trigger**: Brodie uploads a photo or completes a session
**Process**:
1. Generate a social media post draft from the session data + photo
2. Queue for Brodie's approval (one-tap approve on phone)
3. Auto-post to Instagram/Facebook/LinkedIn
4. Monthly: generate a "What We Did This Month" one-pager combining:
   - Session count + attendance
   - Photos from camps/gym
   - Community voice quote
   - Budget transparency snapshot
5. Auto-email to all funders and partners
6. Update public profile page on JusticeHub: `/org/bg-fit`

**Public Profile Page** (`/org/bg-fit`):
- Brodie's story (from Empathy Ledger + Project Essay)
- Program overview (BAIL + CAMPFIRE)
- Live impact metrics (sessions, participants, outcomes)
- Community voices (stories from Elders, youth, families)
- Partner logos
- Referral form
- "Support This Program" CTA
- Shareable link Brodie can send to anyone: funders, partners, media

#### 5. Grant Intelligence Agent ("The Scout")
**Trigger**: Weekly scan of grant databases
**Process**:
1. Scan GrantConnect, QLD government, philanthropic databases
2. Match against Brodie's org profile: youth justice, Indigenous, remote QLD, fitness, cultural
3. Score relevance and notify: "New FRRR grant for remote community programs — $50k, closes April 30. You've been funded by FRRR before. Want me to draft an application?"
4. If yes: pull from `org_grant_applications` library, reuse sections from past applications, auto-populate impact data from current metrics, generate budget from templates
5. Brodie reviews via voice ("sounds good, but change the camp dates to September") → agent revises and submits

#### 6. Compliance Watchdog ("The Guardian")
**Trigger**: Continuous monitoring
**Process**:
1. Track all compliance documents with expiry dates
2. Blue Card renewals: alert 60 days before expiry
3. Insurance renewals: alert 90 days before
4. ORIC annual reports: alert in October (due December)
5. Grant reports: countdown from 30 days
6. Generate pre-filled templates from org data
7. Track submission status across all portals (SmartyGrants, SRS, myCorp)
8. Escalate to BK/business manager if Brodie doesn't respond within 48 hours

#### 7. Story Sovereignty Agent ("The Keeper")
**Trigger**: New story captured (voice, video, interview)
**Process**:
1. Transcribe and store with consent status
2. Extract ALMA themes (healing, cultural continuity, community empowerment, etc.)
3. Link to Empathy Ledger storyteller profile
4. Tag for use in: grant applications, funder reports, website, social media
5. Track which stories have been used where (prevent overuse)
6. Ensure cultural protocols: Elder stories require Elder approval before external use
7. Generate impact narrative: "15 storytellers have shared their experiences. Key themes: healing (92%), safe spaces (92%), cultural continuity (80%)"
8. Feed into public profile and funder reports

### How This Connects to JusticeHub

BG Fit becomes the **first org profile** on JusticeHub's shared services platform. The architecture scales to any grassroots org:

1. **Org Profile** → lives at `/org/bg-fit` on JusticeHub
2. **Grant Tracker** → dashboard at `/org/bg-fit/grants`
3. **Impact Dashboard** → public view at `/org/bg-fit/impact`
4. **Referral Portal** → partner-facing at `/org/bg-fit/refer`
5. **Story Repository** → Empathy Ledger-connected at `/org/bg-fit/stories`
6. **Funder View** → shareable link for each active grant

The same tables, agents, and workflows serve any organisation that needs:
- Grant reconciliation without an accountant
- Impact counting without a data analyst
- Compliance tracking without a project manager
- Communications without a marketing team
- Grant writing without a consultant
- Storytelling without losing sovereignty

**Brodie is the case study. The backend is the product.**
