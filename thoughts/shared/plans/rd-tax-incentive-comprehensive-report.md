## 6. What Needs Documentation

### For Each R&D Activity:
1. **Technical uncertainty** — What didn't you know? What was the experiment?
2. **Hypothesis** — What approach were you testing?
3. **Method** — How did you investigate (code, prototype, field research)?
4. **Outcome** — What did you learn? Did the hypothesis hold?
5. **Records** — Contemporaneous logs, git commits, emails, photos

### Specific Documentation Needed:

| Area | What to Document | Evidence Available |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Living Intelligence Platform | AI agent experiments, integration challenges, architecture decisions | Git commits, Notion docs, code repos |
| Empathy Ledger | Storytelling tech experiments, AI classification, cultural sensitivity | Git commits, design docs |
| Goods Manufacturing | Defy Design prototypes, material tests, supply chain experiments | Invoices, emails, photos |
| International Research | Social enterprise models studied, findings, methodology | Travel records, notes, photos |
| Hardware Prototyping | IoT experiments, edge computing, connectivity tests | Purchase records, build logs |
| Travel Attribution | Which trips were to R&D project sites vs general business | Calendar entries, flight records |
| Labour Allocation | % of time spent on R&D by Nic and BK | Retrospective time estimate, calendar |

### Key Sources of Evidence Already Available:
- **Git repositories** — full commit history across 7+ codebases
- **Gmail** — 4 mailboxes synced with project tagging
- **Notion** — project documentation
- **Xero** — all financial records tagged by project
- **Calendar** — Google Calendar events with project codes
- **Telegram** — bot conversation history showing R&D work
- **Supabase** — database showing all R&D pipeline development

---

## 7. Pty Ltd Registration — Step by Step

### Prerequisites (Do These First)

**Step 1: Get Director ID Numbers (free)**
- Both you (Benjamin) and Nicholas need a Director Identification Number
- Apply at [abrs.gov.au/director-identification-number](https://www.abrs.gov.au/director-identification-number)
- You'll need: Tax File Number, MyGovID (Standard or Strong)
- Processing: Usually instant online
- **Do this TODAY — it's required before company registration**

**Step 2: Choose Company Details**
- **Company name:** Decide on the name (e.g., "A Curious Tractor Pty Ltd" or "ACT Social Enterprise Pty Ltd")
  - Check name availability at [ASIC](https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx)
  - You can also register as a number-only name (cheaper, no name check needed)
- **Registered office address:** Must be a physical address in Australia (not PO Box)
- **Principal place of business:** Where you mainly operate from
- **Directors:** Who will be directors (minimum 1 for Pty Ltd)
- **Shareholders:** Who owns shares and in what proportion
- **Share structure:** Usually $1 ordinary shares (e.g., 100 shares)

### Registration Process

**Step 3: Register the Company ($611)**
- Go to [Business Registration Service](https://register.business.gov.au/)
- Complete Form 201 online
- You can register the company, ABN, and GST all in one application
- Pay the $611 ASIC registration fee
- Processing: Usually 1-2 business days for online applications
- You'll receive an **ACN (Australian Company Number)** immediately or within days

**Step 4: Apply for ABN (free, same application)**
- Can be done simultaneously with company registration
- Will be linked to your new ACN
- Processing: Usually same day

**Step 5: Register for GST (free, required if turnover > $75k)**
- Can also be done in the same application
- Required given ACT's turnover exceeds $75k
- Quarterly BAS lodgment required

**Step 6: Set Up Company Essentials**
- [ ] Open a company bank account (NAB business account)
- [ ] Set up Xero for the new entity
- [ ] Get company tax file number (ATO will issue automatically)
- [ ] Set up PAYG withholding (if paying salaries)
- [ ] Transfer/assign existing contracts and subscriptions
- [ ] Update ABN on invoices

### Family Trust (Discuss with Accountant)

Per your existing decision, a family trust should be set up to hold shares in the Pty Ltd for tax efficiency:
- Discretionary (family) trust — allows flexible income distribution
- Trust deed: ~$500-1,500 through a solicitor or accountant
- The trust becomes the shareholder of the Pty Ltd
- **Engage your accountant BEFORE setting up the trust** — structure matters
