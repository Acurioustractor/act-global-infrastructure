### Station Precinct Employment Pathways: Community Manufacturing and Justice Reintegration

**Project Overview**

Palm Island Community Company (PICC) proposes to establish a community-led employment pathways program based at its Station Precinct in Townsville — a site held under a 30-year lease by PICC — creating structured transitions into work for First Nations people who have had contact with the justice system. The program centres on a goods production facility manufacturing essential items from recycled materials, combined with hospitality training, cultural enterprise, and on-country work, providing participants with real skills, real wages, and a real sense of purpose.

Palm Island has one of the highest rates of incarceration of First Nations people in Queensland. The community faces severe employment scarcity, with limited local industry beyond government services. Yet PICC already employs 197 people — over 80% Indigenous — and generates $9.75 million in economic output annually. The Station Precinct extends this proven employment model into a new domain: goods manufacturing and justice reintegration, using community-owned infrastructure to create pathways that don't currently exist.

**How This Project Aligns with Innovation Fund Objectives**

This project directly addresses both fund objectives. First, it builds sustainable, community-led pathways from justice system contact into employment through a model that is culturally safe by design: participants work in a community-controlled facility, producing goods that serve their own community, guided by Elders and community leaders rather than external service providers. PICC's existing Women's Healing Service already provides re-entry support and remand assistance across Palm Island and Townsville — this program extends that justice reintegration work into structured employment. The program is trauma-informed not through clinical frameworks imposed from outside, but through the healing power of purposeful work, cultural connection, and community belonging.

Second, it fosters genuine collaboration between stakeholders. PICC Board member Harriet Hulthen brings over 12 years as an Official Visitor to Queensland correctional facilities, providing direct links to the justice system. PICC will establish formal partnerships with correctional services, regional employment providers, and Diagrama (an international youth justice organisation) to create referral pathways and post-program employment opportunities. Through consortium partner ACT's JusticeHub platform, participants receive ongoing support navigating justice system obligations, employment documentation, and compliance requirements — reducing the administrative barriers that commonly derail reintegration.

**Activities**

The program operates across four interconnected streams:

*Stream 1 — Goods Manufacturing and Circular Economy.* The Station Precinct's work sheds will be activated as a goods production facility, training participants in manufacturing recycled-plastic bed bases and refurbishing washing machines for Palm Island families and regional communities. These are essential items in chronic short supply on Palm Island. Participants progress from entry-level production through to advanced roles including quality control, logistics, and small business management, building transferable trade and enterprise skills while diverting waste from landfill.

*Stream 2 — Hospitality and Cultural Enterprise.* The Station Precinct includes a commercial kitchen block that will be reactivated for catering and hospitality training. Combined with PICC's established Elders program and Mounty Yarns storytelling, participants develop skills in cultural production — photography, film, digital media, and cultural tourism support. Palm Island's existing cultural assets (18 years of community documentation, Manbarra language materials, Elder knowledge projects) become the foundation for a sustainable cultural enterprise.

*Stream 3 — On-Country Work and Construction Pathways.* Participants gain hands-on construction experience helping build out the Station Precinct itself — repairing infrastructure, constructing modular accommodation, and reviving the site's creek and orchard system. This stream connects to PICC's ranger program networks and on-country land management work, providing pathways into environmental and cultural land management.

*Stream 4 — Cross-Community Exchange.* In partnership with Oonchiumpa (Central Australia) and Brodie Germaine Fitness Aboriginal Corporation (Mount Isa/Lower Gulf), participants engage in cross-community exchanges that broaden perspectives, build networks, and connect the Station Precinct employment model with parallel programs in other regions. Short-stay accommodation at the Precinct supports visiting trainees and mentors from partner communities.

**Location**

Primary delivery at the **PICC Station Precinct, Townsville, QLD** — a community-owned site serving as the bridge between Townsville services and Palm Island community. Cross-community exchange activities in **Central Australia** (Oonchiumpa) and **Mount Isa/Lower Gulf** (BAIL program sites in Doomadgee, Burketown, Normanton). Palm Island, accessible by ferry from Townsville, has a population of approximately 2,500 — the vast majority First Nations.

**Participants and Duration**

The project will support approximately 60-80 participants over four years, with an expected 30-40 transitioning into ongoing paid employment, apprenticeships, or self-managed enterprise. Participants will be First Nations people aged 16 and over who are currently in the justice system (on community-based court orders or day release) or have exited within the past two years. The program operates from July 2026 to June 2030, with a six-month establishment phase followed by rolling cohorts of 6-10 participants per quarter.

**Indicative Cost**

Total funding sought: approximately $1.2 million over four years ($300,000 per year), covering program coordinator and production manager wages, participant wages during training, Elder and mentor stipends, production facility setup and materials, cross-community exchange travel, technology platform costs, hospitality training equipment, and project administration. This investment is expected to generate a self-sustaining production enterprise by Year 3, with ongoing employment capacity beyond the grant period.

**Community Leadership**

PICC has operated for over 18 years as a 100% Indigenous-led organisation, growing from one employee to 197 under CEO Rachel Atkinson's leadership. PICC achieved full community control in 2021, runs Palm Island's health services (2,283 clients, 17,488 service episodes annually), social enterprises (bakery, fuel, mechanics), and the Digital Service Centre employing 21 community members. This program is not designed for Palm Island by outsiders; it is designed by Palm Island people, using community-owned infrastructure, extending a proven employment model into manufacturing and justice reintegration.

### Still to Verify with Rachel

- [ ] **CATSI/Supply Nation status** — ACN confirmed but need to know if ACCO self-declaration is needed
- [ ] **Station Precinct current state** — described as "fallow" and needing cleanup in site plan. Is cleanup underway? What's the realistic timeline for production facility activation?
- [ ] **Participant numbers** — 60-80 over 4 years realistic given Townsville base (not just Palm Island)?
- [ ] **Budget** — $1.2M over 4 years with facility activation costs — realistic?
- [ ] **Diagrama partnership** — confirmed and willing to be named?
- [ ] **Consortium partners** — all confirmed and willing?
- [ ] **ORIC/compliance status** — current with all reporting?
- [ ] **National Redress Scheme** — ensure PICC is not on the excluded list

### Key Change: Station Precinct (Townsville), not Centre Precinct (Palm Island)

The v2 draft referred to "Centre Precinct on Palm Island." The Station Precinct is actually in **Townsville** — which is strategically significant because:
1. It bridges Townsville services and Palm Island community
2. Participants on community-based orders in Townsville can attend easily
3. The site has existing infrastructure (commercial kitchen, work sheds) ready for activation
4. It connects to PICC's Townsville office (Sturt Street) and Women's Healing Service

**Question for Rachel**: Is the correct framing "Station Precinct" or a different name? Is there also a Centre Precinct on Palm Island, and if so, is it involved in this project?

### Assessment Scoring Guide

Single criterion, 100% weighting, scored out of 5. Need 3+ to proceed to Stage Two.

**What assessors look for:**
1. Alignment with fund objectives and outcomes
2. Community-led, culturally safe, trauma-informed approach
3. Activities described
4. Location(s)
5. Indicative cost
6. Participant numbers
7. Duration

### Editing Approach

**Round 1 — Accuracy (you + Rachel)**
- Is the Station Precinct description right? What's the current state vs what's planned?
- Is goods production (bed bases, washing machines) confirmed as the focus?
- Does the consortium structure reflect real relationships?
- Are participant numbers realistic?
- Is the Townsville location right, or should it reference Palm Island more?

**Round 2 — Strength (strategic review)**
- Does every sentence serve the assessment criteria?
- Is PICC's track record (197 employees, $9.75M output, full community control) front and centre?
- Is the innovation angle clear? (Circular economy manufacturing + justice reintegration + cross-community exchange)
- Does it differentiate from standard employment programs? (Yes — goods production + existing Women's Healing re-entry work)
- Is the self-sustainability angle strong enough? (Production enterprise generating revenue by Year 3)

**Round 3 — Compliance (final)**
- Word count under 900
- All seven elements addressed (alignment, community-led, activities, location, cost, participants, duration)
- No hyperlinks
- No jargon without explanation
- Language is plain, compelling, and sounds like a community org not a consultant

### Tone Notes

This should read like **PICC talking about their own community and infrastructure** — not a tech company pitching a platform. JusticeHub and ACT should appear as tools that support the community program, not as the centrepiece. The Station Precinct, goods manufacturing, and PICC's proven track record is the story.
