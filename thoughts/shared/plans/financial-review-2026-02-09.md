## 5. Project-Specific Financial Reviews

### 5.1 The Harvest (ACT-HV)

**12-Month Tracked Spend:** $9,455 (44 transactions)
- Chris Witta (maintenance/labour): $6,678 (15 transactions)
- Flight Bar Witta (supplies/food): $2,490 (24 transactions)
- Nest In Witta (nursery): $288 (5 transactions)

**No tracked revenue** against ACT-HV code, but confirmed incoming:
- Regional Arts Australia Fellowship: $45,000 confirmed (3 invoices raised)
- Grant Build Funding: $100,000 negotiating (scenario only)
- Green Fox Training: $9,000 invoiced but 98 days overdue

**Cashflow Forecast - Scenario A (With $100K Grant):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| RAA Fellowship | +$45,000 |
| Grant Build Funding | +$100,000 |
| Green Fox Training | +$9,000 |
| Chris Witta (maintenance) | -$6,000/yr |
| Flight Bar (supplies) | -$3,600/yr |
| Nest In Witta | -$600/yr |
| Susie (proposed 4d/wk) | -$26,000/yr |
| **Net** | **+$117,800** |

**Cashflow Forecast - Scenario B (Without $100K Grant):**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| RAA Fellowship | +$45,000 |
| Green Fox Training | +$9,000 |
| Running costs | -$10,200/yr |
| Susie (if hired) | -$26,000/yr |
| **Net** | **+$17,800** |

**Recommendation:** Susie hire should be contingent on $100K grant outcome. Without it, net margin is thin.

## 8. Project Code Tracking Gap

**Only 3.5% of transactions have project codes assigned.** Breakdown:
| Project | SPEND txns | SPEND total | RECEIVE txns | RECEIVE total |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Untracked | 2,007 | $788,971 | 171 | $355,926 |
| ACT-OS | 4 | $648 | 21 | $44,014 |
| ACT-HV | 44 | $9,455 | 0 | $0 |
| ACT-JP | 3 | $479 | 1 | $229 |
| ACT-GL | 0 | $0 | 1 | $450 |
| ACT-10 | 1 | $220 | 0 | $0 |
| ACT-GD | 1 | $23 | 0 | $0 |
| ACT-SM | 3 | $19 | 0 | $0 |

**Recommendation:** Improve Xero tracking categories. Most spend (especially travel, contractors, Defy) should be tagged to projects. This would dramatically improve project-level financial visibility.
