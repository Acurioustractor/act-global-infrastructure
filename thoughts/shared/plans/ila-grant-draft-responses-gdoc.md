PROJECT SUMMARY (~150 words)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"Voices on Country" is a 36-month Elder-led program of cultural knowledge journeys, Manbarra language conservation, and photographic exhibition with video elements, based on Palm Island, Queensland.

Palm Island is home to the Bwgcolman people — descendants of over 52 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations forcibly removed to the island under government policies spanning more than a century. The Elders who lead this project carry languages, stories, and cultural knowledge from communities across Queensland and beyond, alongside Manbarra, the language of Palm Island's Traditional Owners. This extraordinary convergence of cultures, forged through hardship, makes "Voices on Country" unlike any other language and arts project in Australia.

The Elders group will undertake two major return-to-Country journeys — the Atherton Tablelands (Year 1) and Central Australia (Year 2) — where Elders travel back to the homelands their families were taken from, recording oral histories, language, and cultural knowledge through photography, short interview videos, and audio on Country. The project builds on a successful 2025 Mission Beach journey where 8 Elders recorded 12 filmed interviews.

It will produce a major photographic exhibition with integrated video elements, short knowledge films, a Manbarra language resource for the community's school language program, a permanent Elders cultural space, and a sovereign digital archive with tiered access protecting sacred and private material. Photography is the primary medium — authentic, intensive documentation capturing the full depth of Elders' knowledge on Country.

PICC is a Tier 1 Indigenous community-controlled organisation on Bwgcolman country. Every element of this project was conceived and is driven by Elders — a celebration of determination, strength, and resilience.

CRITERION 1: Ability to meet ILA program objectives (40%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

How will the activity address ILA language and arts objectives?

This project delivers an integrated language and arts program through Elder-led knowledge journeys, rooted in the unique cultural history of the Bwgcolman people.

Language conservation (Objective 2.1c):
Palm Island's Bwgcolman community carries an extraordinary linguistic heritage. As descendants of over 52 nations forcibly removed to the island, Elders hold fragments of languages from across Queensland and beyond — alongside Manbarra (also called Mulkal), the traditional language of Palm Island's Traditional Owners. Manbarra was severely disrupted through mission-era suppression, yet weekly school language classes have begun and Allan Palm Island, a Manbarra Traditional Owner and PICC Director, leads cultural authority for language revival on the island. Much vocabulary, place names, kinship terms, and contextual language knowledge exists only with Elders. This project records Elders speaking Manbarra on Country — capturing language in its living cultural context across two significant journey regions. Where Elders carry language knowledge from their own nations of origin, these too will be documented and preserved. A dedicated Manbarra language worker will extract vocabulary, phrases, and place names from all recordings to produce a structured language resource that feeds directly into the existing school program and broader community revival efforts.

Photography and arts production (Objective 2.2a, 2.2b):
The primary artistic output is a photographic exhibition documenting Elders' return to ancestral homelands, with integrated video elements — short interview films and knowledge recordings captured alongside the photography. This mixed-media approach allows intensive, authentic engagement with Elders: some sessions are filmed, others are quieter photographic documentation without cameras rolling, getting the most out of each Elder's knowledge and comfort. Short films and interview videos produced from each journey will feature within the exhibition and as standalone knowledge resources. The approach builds on the Mission Beach film model while expanding into photography as the primary medium for exhibition.

Intergenerational transfer:
Younger Bwgcolman community members participate as production assistants across both journeys, learning cultural knowledge directly from Elders while gaining skills in photography, filmmaking, audio recording, and exhibition curation. For young people who may not know which of the 52+ nations their families came from, these journeys reconnect threads of identity that removal policies severed. The Central Australia journey includes a collaborative live event at Atnarpa homestead bringing together Palm Island Elders with young people from the Bloomfield family's Oonchiumpa youth diversion program — connecting two remote Indigenous communities through intergenerational storytelling and cultural exchange. Community exhibition events on Palm Island and in partner communities share the stories broadly.

Data sovereignty:
All recorded material — photographs, video, and audio — is classified through a four-tier access system developed with Elders:
  • Public — exhibition prints, edited short films
  • Community — full interviews and photo archive via local network
  • Family — password-protected family stories and portraits
  • Sacred — offline only, Elder-approved access

The project's digital archive will be built on Mukurtu, a free, open-source platform designed specifically by and for Indigenous communities to manage cultural heritage with customised cultural protocol access controls. PICC will collaborate with Tranby Aboriginal College and the Jumbunna Institute (UTS) on Mukurtu implementation, connecting Palm Island's archive to established national Indigenous digital curation networks. On-Country digital infrastructure ensures knowledge stays under community control.

The project addresses all five Voices of Country themes: stopping the loss of Manbarra language and the languages carried by Bwgcolman Elders, centring community, intergenerational knowledge transfer, caring for Country through return journeys to ancestral homelands, and truth-telling through photography and film — telling the story of 52+ nations brought together on one island, and the determination, strength, and resilience that sustains them. It directly contributes to Closing the Gap Target 16.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITERION 2: Community engagement, support and benefit (40%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

How have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people been involved in designing this activity?

This project was conceived, designed, and driven entirely by Palm Island Elders during regular Elders group meetings. The Bwgcolman Elders who lead this project represent the living cultural memory of over 52 nations — their knowledge journeys are not abstract heritage exercises but deeply personal returns to the homelands their families were taken from. The destinations, methods, and cultural protocols all emerged from Elder-led discussions.

Elders chose the Atherton Tablelands because many families originate from Mareeba, Ravenshoe, and surrounding Tablelands communities before forced removal to Palm Island. When an Elder travels back to Ravenshoe to record stories in language on the Country their grandmother was taken from, this is truth-telling and healing at the most fundamental level. The Central Australia journey connects to an existing partnership with the Bloomfield family — Traditional Owners of Mparntwe (Alice Springs) — who operate Oonchiumpa, a 100% Aboriginal-led youth diversion and on-Country healing program from their ancestral cattle station at Atnarpa (Loves Creek Station). The Bloomfield family will host the Palm Island Elders at Atnarpa homestead for cross-cultural knowledge exchange, intergenerational storytelling, and a collaborative photography exhibition and live event with young people from both communities.

The project works in alignment with Manbarra Traditional Owners, led by Allan Palm Island (PICC Director), who hold cultural authority over Palm Island itself. The Bwgcolman identity — born from the convergence of 52+ nations on Manbarra country — is honoured by centring both the Traditional Owners' language and the diverse cultural knowledge that Elders carry from their nations of origin.

The Elders group has been meeting continuously since 2016 and fundraised independently for two years to support their first heritage journey to Mission Beach in 2025. That trip — where 8 Elders recorded 12 filmed interviews about Hull River cyclone history and family displacement — demonstrated both the depth of community commitment and the model's effectiveness. Elders also presented their work at the SNAICC national conference, sharing their approach to intergenerational knowledge transmission with a national audience.

How will the community benefit?

Knowledge preservation: Systematically recording Manbarra language and the cultural knowledge carried by Bwgcolman Elders from 52+ nations before it is lost. The language resource directly supports Palm Island's school program. No other community in Australia holds this concentration of diverse cultural knowledge in such urgent need of preservation.

Wellbeing and healing: The Mission Beach journey demonstrated profound wellbeing outcomes — reconnection to Country, healing through storytelling, and strengthened Elder bonds. For Bwgcolman Elders, returning to ancestral homelands is an act of healing from the displacement and disconnection that defined Palm Island's history. Two further journeys deepen this over 36 months.

Cultural infrastructure: The Elders room installation (timeline wall, historical photos, room naming in Manbarra) creates a permanent cultural space. The Mukurtu-based digital archive — built on a platform designed specifically for Indigenous communities — serves the community long after the project ends and connects Palm Island to national Indigenous digital curation networks through collaboration with Tranby Aboriginal College and the Jumbunna Institute (UTS).

Employment and skills: Indigenous project coordinator, Manbarra language worker, and young community members gain professional skills in photography, filmmaking, audio recording, language documentation, exhibition curation, and project management.

Inter-community connections: Journeys strengthen relationships with Tablelands and Central Australian communities. The Year 2 Central Australia journey includes a collaborative exhibition and live cultural exchange event at Atnarpa homestead, bringing together Palm Island Elders with the Bloomfield family and young people from Oonchiumpa's youth diversion program — connecting two remote Indigenous communities through shared knowledge and intergenerational storytelling.

PICC is a Tier 1 Indigenous community-controlled organisation with 100% Indigenous governance on Bwgcolman country. Every aspect — from conception through delivery — is led by the community it serves. This project is a celebration of the determination, strength, and resilience of the Bwgcolman people — and of the great peoples from across this land whose cultures converge on Palm Island.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITERION 3: Capability and capacity (20%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

How will you manage and deliver this activity?

Organisational capacity:
PICC has operated continuously for over 18 years, managing complex community programs including a $4.9 million tourism masterplan and partnerships with federal programs. PICC holds current ABN registration, maintains audited financial statements, and has an experienced Indigenous Board of Directors with robust governance and financial oversight.

Proven track record:
This project directly scales a proven model. In 2025, PICC coordinated and delivered a Mission Beach Elder heritage journey — managing travel logistics for 8 Elders across multiple days, cultural site visits, photography, and film production. The resulting 12 filmed interviews, 148 documented quotes, and photographic documentation demonstrate PICC's ability to deliver exactly this type of activity. Elders subsequently presented their work at the SNAICC national conference.

Key personnel:
  • Rachel Atkinson (CEO) — Yorta Yorta woman, 25+ years leading Indigenous organisations, SNAICC Board Director, Co-Chair Family Matters Queensland. Project governance and reporting.
  • Allan Palm Island (Traditional Owner Director) — Manbarra Traditional Owner, artist, cultural authority. Cultural protocols and Elder engagement.
  • Project Coordinator (Indigenous, to be recruited) — Day-to-day coordination, logistics, community liaison.
  • Manbarra Language Worker (Elder or community member) — Language extraction, word list development, school program liaison.
  • Professional Photographer/Filmmaker (contract) — Photography, short film and interview video production across both journeys. Exhibition curation and post-production.
  • ACT (technical partner) — Digital archive infrastructure, Mukurtu platform implementation, exhibition design support.
  • Tranby Aboriginal College / Jumbunna Institute (UTS) (collaboration partner) — Mukurtu platform guidance, Indigenous digital curation expertise, connection to national archiving networks.

Risk management:
  • Travel disruption — Flexible scheduling within 36-month timeline; seasonal planning (October trips)
  • Elder health — Support workers accompany all travel; rest days built into every itinerary
  • Cultural sensitivity — All content reviewed by Elders before any use; tiered access ensures protection
  • Staff turnover — 36-month timeline allows for handover; documentation of all processes

Monitoring:
PICC will collect participation numbers, Elder wellbeing feedback, language items documented, exhibition attendance, and school program uptake. Annual progress reports and a comprehensive final report will document outcomes against each ILA objective.

IN-KIND AND CO-CONTRIBUTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

These contributions reduce the cost to the grant and demonstrate genuine community investment. All staffing, Elder consultation fees, and journey costs are still paid from the grant budget — co-contributions cover additional costs and value that the grant does not need to fund.

PICC cash co-contributions:
  • Top-up travel and accommodation costs if actual prices exceed grant budget lines for either journey (est. $10,000/trip = $20,000)
  • Elder participation payments for project planning meetings, cultural governance sessions, content review, and community consultations throughout the 36 months — outside of the 10-day journey consultation fees funded by the grant (est. $5,000/yr x 3 = $15,000)

PICC in-kind contributions:
  • Elders meeting room, office space, and community facilities provided rent-free for project coordination, planning meetings, and exhibition events (est. $8,000/yr x 3 = $24,000)
  • Elder group coordination — weekly meetings, cultural governance oversight, community engagement that PICC already facilitates as part of its ongoing programs (est. $15,000/yr x 3 = $45,000)
  • Community networks, Traditional Owner authority, and cultural permissions — relationships and trust built over 18+ years that cannot be replicated or purchased
  • Existing school language program infrastructure, teachers, and curriculum integration support for the Manbarra language resource

Bloomfield family / Oonchiumpa (Year 2 — paid from grant + in-kind):
  • Hosting, cultural facilitation, and youth coordination are paid from the grant ($16,000 — see Year 2 budget)
  • Additional in-kind: station vehicle access, catering support beyond grant meals budget, safety and operations on Country, exhibition venue logistics (est. $8,000)

ACT in-kind contributions:
  • Technical partnership — digital archive architecture, Mukurtu platform implementation support, data sovereignty system design (est. $20,000 over 3 years)
  • Exhibition design support — layout, digital elements, video integration (est. $10,000)

Total co-contributions: est. $142,000
  (PICC cash $35,000 + PICC in-kind $69,000+ + Bloomfield/Oonchiumpa in-kind $8,000 + ACT $30,000)

Total project value: $515,900 (grant) + $142,000 (co-contributions) = $657,900


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT PICC NEEDS TO DO BEFORE 16 MARCH 2026
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Organisational Checks (do first — could be blockers)

[ ] Confirm PICC ABN is current and GST registration status
[ ] Check National Redress Scheme — PICC must not be on the excluded organisations list (or must have joined the scheme). Check at nationalredress.gov.au. If PICC is excluded, cannot apply.
[ ] Check Appendix B of the Guidelines — is Manbarra/Mulkal language supported by an existing ILA-funded language centre? If yes, PICC should consult with that centre and the application needs to explain how this project differs from or complements their work.
[ ] Confirm Rachel Atkinson is comfortable with PICC as lead applicant at Major scale ($515,900 over 36 months)

STEP 2: SmartyGrants Form (the actual application)

[ ] Register/login at arts.smartygrants.com.au — PICC needs an account
[ ] Open ILA 2026-27 Open Competitive form — review all fields
[ ] Map the draft responses to the exact form fields — the form may have specific character limits or different question wording. Adjust as needed.
[ ] Organisational details section — ABN, incorporation details, contact person, postal address, governance structure
[ ] Activity type selection — select both Language AND Arts
[ ] Scale selection — Major
[ ] Project location — Palm Island, QLD (remote community)
[ ] Language identification — Manbarra (also known as Mulkal/Mulkay). Specify language group/family if form asks.
[ ] Budget entry — enter the line-item budget into the form's budget template

STEP 3: Letters of Support & Evidence (collect from community)

KEY STRATEGIC NOTES (internal — do not include in application)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Why Major ($515,900 over 36 months) is the right scale:
  • Two major knowledge journeys + photographic exhibition with video elements + Manbarra language resource + sovereign digital archive + Elders cultural space = Major-level complexity
  • The FAQs arts example: "culminate in an exhibition" — our major combined exhibition directly mirrors this
  • 36 months allows proper Elder-paced delivery: Year 1 = Tablelands journey, Year 2 = Central Australia journey, Year 3 = exhibition curation, archive build, language resource, and legacy
  • No compromises: 10 Elders per trip, 10-day journeys, $300/day Elder consultation fees, professional photography and film, touring exhibition
  • All years well under the $200K/year cap ($200K, $200K, $116K)
  • Year 3 at reduced scale ($116K) demonstrates efficient wind-down and sustainability planning

Differentiators that make this application stand out:
  1. 52+ nations, one community — Bwgcolman people carry cultural knowledge from over 52 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations. No other language/arts project in Australia has this scope of cultural convergence and this urgency of preservation
  2. Tier 1 Indigenous org on a remote island — geographic and organisational preference
  3. Proven model — Mission Beach film is hard evidence, not a promise
  4. Genuine Elder-led — the meeting transcript is undeniable organic evidence
  5. Manbarra + multi-nation language — centring Traditional Owner language while also preserving the diverse languages Elders carry from their nations of origin
  6. Data sovereignty — tiered access system is sophisticated and aligns with ICIP principles
  7. All 5 Voices of Country themes addressed
  8. Dual language + arts — the guidelines say they value projects with both
  9. Resilience narrative — a celebration of determination, strength, and resilience over the history of hardship and disconnection that Palm Island endured
  10. Cross-community — Elders returning to homelands across Australia. Year 2 hosted by Bloomfield family at Atnarpa with Oonchiumpa youth
  11. Intergenerational — young Bwgcolman people reconnecting with nations of origin alongside Elders
  12. SNAICC presentation — national-level credibility already established
  13. Sustainability — digital archive, language resource, and exhibition assets outlive the grant
  14. Mukurtu platform — purpose-built Indigenous digital archive, collaboration with Tranby/Jumbunna

What NOT to include in the application (ILA rules):
  • No Kriol/Yumplatok/Pidgin focus (explicitly excluded from ILA)
