## 3. The Project — Mapped to Elders' Discussion

### What the Elders Want

From the meeting transcript, the Elders articulated a clear vision:

1. **Atherton Tablelands knowledge journey** (Oct/Nov 2026) — visiting cultural sites, museums, rangers, bush food gardens in Mareeba, Ravenshoe, and surrounding areas where many Palm Island families originated
2. **Central Australia knowledge exchange** (Oct/Nov 2027) — hosted by the Bloomfield family (Traditional Owners of Mparntwe/Alice Springs) at Atnarpa homestead (Loves Creek Station). Cross-cultural exchange with Oonchiumpa youth diversion program. Collaborative exhibition/live event with young people from both communities.
3. **Continuation of Mission Beach film model** — interviews, cultural site visits, storytelling on Country, photographed and filmed
3. **Data sovereignty** — tiered access (some stories public, some protected/sacred, stored locally on Country)
4. **Elders room cultural space** — timeline wall, photo collage, naming in language (Kunwara/Yuri discussed)
5. **Language capture** — recording Manbarra/Mulkal words, place names, stories in language during journeys
6. **Wellbeing through culture** — the trip is simultaneously respite, knowledge collection, and cultural reconnection

### Existing Evidence (from PICC Repository)

- **Mission Beach film** — 12 filmed elder interviews, 148 quotes, Hull River cyclone history (1918), detailed itinerary documented
- **8 elders participated** with full bios and spoken contributions
- **Manbarra language content** — Mulkal vocabulary, Bougamambara (Great Palm Island), place names, language revival classes at school
- **PICC Annual Reports** — 18 years of documentation (2009-2024)
- **SNAICC presentation** — Jeannie and another elder presented at SNAICC conference about the group
- **Cultural protocol system** — tiered access already built into PICC's digital platform (public/community/family/restricted/sacred)

---

## 4. Assessment Criteria Alignment

### Criterion 1: Program Outcomes & Objectives (40%)

**ILA Languages Objectives hit:**
- **2.1(c) Developing language resources** — Recording Manbarra/Mulkal language on Country using digital technology (film, audio). Elders capturing place names, stories, and vocabulary during heritage journeys
- **2.1(a) Supporting language transmission** — Intergenerational: Elders speaking language while younger community members film/record. Creates resources for school language classes (already running weekly)
- **2.1(d) Supporting access and participation** — Tiered digital archive allows community access while protecting sacred knowledge

**ILA Arts Objectives hit:**
- **2.2(a) Developing, producing film** — Documentary film following Elders' return to ancestral homelands (Atherton Tablelands). Builds on Mission Beach film (proof of concept)
- **2.2(b) Promoting and celebrating** — Community screening events on Palm Island + Elders room installation (timeline wall, photos)

**Voices of Country themes hit (all 5!):**
1. **Stopping the loss** — Recording language and knowledge from Elders before it's lost
2. **Communities are centre** — 100% Elder-led and driven (transcript proves this)
3. **Intergenerational knowledge transfer** — Elders recording for younger generations
4. **Caring for Country** — Journeys back to ancestral Country (Tablelands = origin of many families)
5. **Truth-telling and celebration** — Hull River cyclone story, forced removal history, celebrating survival

**Closing the Gap Target 16:** Direct contribution — *"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and languages are strong, supported and flourishing"*

**Work plan sketch (12 months from Aug 2026):**

| Month | Activity | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Pre-production: Elder consultations, itinerary planning, cultural permissions, equipment setup | Cultural protocol agreement, trip itinerary, filming plan |
| 3 | Elders room cultural installation | Timeline wall, photo collage, room naming ceremony |
| 4-5 | **Atherton Tablelands Knowledge Journey** (10-14 days) | 15-20 filmed interviews, language recordings, cultural site documentation |
| 6-8 | Post-production: Editing, transcription, language extraction, tiered access classification | Draft film, transcribed interviews, Manbarra word list |
| 9-10 | Community review: Elders review all content, classify access tiers, approve for sharing | Approved film, cultural protocol register |
| 11 | Community screening events + digital archive setup | 2-3 screenings on Palm Island, local server archive |
| 12 | Reporting, evaluation, planning for future trips | Final report, impact data, future funding plan |

### Criterion 2: Community Engagement & Benefit (40%)

**This is the strongest card.** The transcript itself is undeniable evidence of shared decision-making.

Key points to make:
- **Elder-led from inception**: The Elders chose the destination (Tablelands), the format (continuation of Mission Beach model), the timing, and the purpose
- **Shared decision-making**: The meeting transcript shows organic discussion, debate, and consensus — not top-down project design
- **Building on existing program**: Elders group has been meeting since 2016, fundraised for 2 years before first trip, already delivered Mission Beach journey successfully
- **Community benefit**: Knowledge preservation for future generations, language resources for school programs, wellbeing outcomes for participating Elders, cultural space (Elders room) for ongoing use
- **Nation of origin connections**: Elders travelling to their ancestral homelands — deeply personal and community-significant

**Evidence of community support (to attach):**
1. Letters of support from Palm Island Elders (signed)
2. Letter from PICC Board (Rachel Atkinson, CEO)
3. Short video testimony from Elders about the project (<25MB!)
4. Mission Beach film excerpt as proof of capability (<25MB)
5. Letter from Tablelands ranger group or cultural museum (if available)

**Non-Indigenous org requirements** (CRITICAL): Since ACT/PICC relationship — need to clarify who is the actual applicant. If PICC applies (Tier 1 Indigenous org), this is massively advantageous. If ACT applies, must demonstrate extensive Indigenous community partnership and provide documentary evidence.

### Criterion 3: Capability & Capacity (20%)

- **PICC track record**: 18+ years operating, 100% Indigenous-led, $4.9M tourism masterplan, $355M federal ranger program involvement
- **Mission Beach film**: Proven delivery of identical activity type — elder knowledge journey filmed and archived
- **Personnel**: Rachel Atkinson (CEO, 25+ years Indigenous org leadership, SNAICC Board), Allan Palm Island (Traditional Owner Director, artist), established Elder group
- **Cultural safety**: Existing tiered access system, cultural protocols already embedded in PICC platform
- **ACT support**: Technical partner providing filming, editing, digital archiving capability

## 6. Critical Requirements / Risks

### Must-Do Before 16 March
- [x] **Confirm applicant entity** — PICC applies as Tier 1 Indigenous org (CONFIRMED)
- [ ] **Get PICC ABN & GST registration confirmed**
- [ ] **Draft letters of support** from Elders (signed), PICC Board, community partners
- [ ] **Check National Redress Scheme** — ensure PICC is not on the excluded list (or has joined)
- [ ] **Complete SmartyGrants form** at arts.smartygrants.com.au
- [ ] **Prepare video evidence** — edit Mission Beach film to <25MB clip
- [ ] **Complete Arts Access Australia accessibility template**

### Language Centre Check
The guidelines say to check if Manbarra/Mulkal is supported by an existing ILA-funded language centre. Check Appendix B list. If yes, should consult with that centre and demonstrate clear need for additional/different work.

### What NOT to Include
- No Kriol/Yumplatok/Pidgin focus (explicitly excluded)
- No NAIDOC-specific activities
- No festival/celebration focus — frame as knowledge conservation + arts production
- No international travel
- No land/building purchase
- No assets over $5,000

### Data Sovereignty Approach (the "secret weapon")
The FAQs explicitly confirm: *"The ILA program does not, and will not, retain any intellectual property rights over any activity materials that applicants identify as private and/or secret and sacred Indigenous materials."*

Detailing the tiered access system is a massive differentiator — and using **Mukurtu** (a free, open-source platform designed specifically by and for Indigenous communities) makes it credible and proven:
- **Tier 1 (Public)**: Exhibition prints, edited short films — open access
- **Tier 2 (Community)**: Full interviews, photo archive — via Palm Island local network
- **Tier 3 (Family)**: Family-specific stories and portraits — password-protected
- **Tier 4 (Sacred)**: Restricted knowledge — offline only, Elder-approved access

**Mukurtu** (Warumungu word for "dilly bag" — a safe keeping place) enables customised cultural protocol access controls. Collaboration with **Tranby Aboriginal College** and the **Jumbunna Institute (UTS)** on implementation connects Palm Island to established national Indigenous digital curation networks.

## 7. Narrative Framing

The strongest angle for this application is **intergenerational knowledge transfer through return-to-Country journeys**. The Elders aren't just making a film — they're walking back to the places their families were taken from, recording the knowledge that was disrupted by forced removal, and creating a sovereign archive so that knowledge lives on their terms.

Key phrases to weave through:
- "Community-led and Elder-driven" (direct from Criterion 2)
- "Recording, conserving and making Indigenous languages available using digital technology in a culturally appropriate way" (direct from Objective 2.1c)
- "Intergenerational knowledge transfer" (Voices of Country Theme 3)
- "Truth-telling and celebration" (Voices of Country Theme 5)
- "Shared decision-making" (Closing the Gap Priority Reform 1)

The Hull River cyclone story (1918, ~100 killed, survivors forcibly relocated to Palm Island) provides powerful historical context. The Tablelands trip continues this thread — many Palm Island families were sent from Tablelands communities.
