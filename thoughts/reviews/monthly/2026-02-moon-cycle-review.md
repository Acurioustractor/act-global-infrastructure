# Moon Cycle Review — February 2026

*First moon cycle review. Setting the pattern for monthly reflection on organisational health.*

---

## The Weather Report

How does ACT feel right now? Not the metrics — the feeling.

**Energy:** High but stretched. The infrastructure buildout (bot, dashboard, planning system, git hygiene) has been intense. The PICC Elders Room launch brings purpose and groundedness. There's momentum, but also the familiar risk of two people doing the work of ten.

**Direction:** Clearer than it's been. The decade vision, yearly goals, and decision framework give ACT a spine it hasn't had before. The question is whether we can slow down enough to actually use them.

## Financial Health

### What We Know
- Sole Trader still operating (ABN 21 591 780 066)
- Xero connected, transactions syncing
- Dext processing receipts (auto-publish for subscriptions)
- Subscription tracking active

### What We Don't Know
- Exact operating capital position
- Runway at current burn rate
- Grant pipeline status (systematic tracking not yet built)
- Revenue split across streams

### Actions
- [ ] Pull actual numbers via quarterly review tool
- [ ] Document current financial position honestly
- [ ] Set up monthly financial review as part of this moon cycle practice

### The $100K Question
The Harvest decision framework scored 2.2/5 — below the 3.5 threshold. The conditional proceed framework is clear but requires conversations with Grant that may not have happened yet. This is the biggest financial decision of 2026.

## Project Health

### Thriving
- **PICC Elders Room** (ACT-ER): Funded ($130K), launching this week, Elder-led, deeply mission-aligned. This is ACT at its best.
- **Infrastructure** (ACT-IN): Bot working, dashboard deployed, planning system built, git clean. The invisible work that makes everything else possible.

### Steady
- **JusticeHub** (ACT-JH): Active but Centre of Excellence still in ideation. Needs a push in Q2.
- **Empathy Ledger** (ACT-EL): Platform exists. QFCC engagement provides a real use case. Licensing model undefined.
- **Diagrama** (ACT-DG): Tina and Kristy leading. Less visibility — check in.

### Needs Attention
- **Goods** (ACT-GD): 112+ day gap with Maddi. Either re-engage or formally acknowledge the pause. The On-Country production essays suggest energy exists — is it finding its way to Maddi and the team?
- **The Harvest** (ACT-HV): Decision pending. Framework says conditional proceed. Conditions not yet confirmed.
- **ACT Farm**: Investment deferred while Harvest decision is open. Core infrastructure ($30K) needs to happen regardless.

### Unknown
- Many of the 70 projects in the portfolio are low-touch or dormant. The yearly plan identifies high-priority ones. For the rest: are they alive or should they be formally archived?

---

## Relationship Health

### Strong
- **Palm Island / PICC community**: Active, Elder-led, funded. Narelle Gleeson primary contact.
- **Tim Fairfax Foundation**: Active engagement.
- **Minderoo**: Active (12-day last contact at time of audit).

### Needs Attention
- **Maddi / Goods**: 112-day gap. Priority re-engagement.
- **Jinibara community**: Not yet engaged for The Harvest. This is a gap — we're on Gubbi Gubbi Country and haven't initiated relationship.
- **Grant/Michelle**: Lease negotiation in progress. Four critical questions from decision framework need answers.

### New Relationships Needed
- Accountant for Pty Ltd and Trust setup
- R&D consultant for tax incentive
- Empathy Ledger pilot clients (2-3)

### Communication Infrastructure
- 4 mailboxes syncing (benjamin, nicholas, hi, accounts @act.place)
- 14,804 contacts in system
- 8,289 emails indexed
- Contact intelligence auto-enriching

## Wellbeing

### Ben
- Deep in infrastructure build. Risk: bottleneck on everything technical.
- The planning system and daily bot sync should help distribute cognitive load.
- Joy: building things that work brings energy. But the volume is unsustainable long-term.

### Nic
- Strategy, relationships, The Harvest vision.
- Risk: stretched across too many fronts.
- Joy: The Harvest and community work energise. Administration drains.

### The Team Question
- Two people, 70 projects. This doesn't scale.
- Susie (proposed for Harvest) would help if confirmed.
- Who else does ACT need in 2026? This needs an honest conversation.

## The LCAA Lens

### Listen
What are we hearing this month?
- The Elders are ready for their Room. They've been patient.
- The planning system is asking us to slow down and think before acting.
- The financial uncertainty is asking us to be honest about what we can afford.

### Curiosity
What questions are alive?
- Can two people run a 70-project ecosystem? (No. So what changes?)
- Does The Harvest serve ACT's mission or become ACT's trap?
- What would it mean to actually design for obsolescence — including our own roles?

### Action
What moved forward this month?
- Planning system built (decade → yearly → weekly → daily → moon cycle)
- Bot upgraded (planning tools, writing workflow, prompt caching)
- Git hygiene established (main + dev, v1.1.0 tagged)
- PICC Elders Room launching
- Decision framework created and applied to Harvest

### Art
Where is the art?
- The Elders Room is art — portraits, video, stories from very long ago
- The philosophical essays are art — making meaning from method
- The planning system itself is a kind of art — designing how we think together

## Intentions for March

1. **Make the Harvest decision.** Use the framework. Don't defer.
2. **Re-engage Goods.** Talk to Maddi. Honest conversation about status.
3. **Start entity setup.** Find the accountant. Begin Pty Ltd process.
4. **Use the planning system.** Daily syncs, weekly reviews. See if the cadence holds.
5. **Joy check.** Ask honestly: is this sustainable? What needs to change?

## Closing Reflection

This is the first moon cycle review. The practice of stopping once a month to look at the whole — not just the tasks but the health of the organism — is itself a form of care.

ACT is building something real. The risk isn't failure — it's burnout, over-extension, and losing sight of why we started. The tractor metaphor matters: we transfer power. We don't become the permanent driver.

The question for March: **Where are we driving when we should be handing over the keys?**
