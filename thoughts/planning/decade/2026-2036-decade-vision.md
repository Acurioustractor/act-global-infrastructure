# ACT Decade Vision: 2026-2036

## The Arc

This is not a business plan. It's a direction of travel for a philosophical movement that uses art, technology, and radical listening to transfer power to communities.

By 2036, ACT should be largely unnecessary. The communities we work with should own their stories, their economies, their land, and their futures. If we're still running things in ten years, we've failed.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (2026-2028)

**Theme: Build the engine, prove the model**

### Entity and Structure
- Establish ACT Pty Ltd as the operating entity
- Set up Family Trust for tax-efficient distribution
- Wind down Sole Trader cleanly
- Park A Kind Tractor LTD until needed for charitable vehicle
- Formalise the 40% profit share commitment in governance documents

### Physical Places
- **The Harvest** (Year 1-2): Prove the community hub model on Gubbi Gubbi Country. Clear financial milestones. If Grant's vision doesn't align with community ownership, exit gracefully by Year 2.
- **ACT Farm** (Year 1-3): Core infrastructure — water, power, basic facilities. Begin regeneration works. This is the long-term asset. ACT controls this.
- The Harvest serves ACT Farm. Not the other way around.

### Core Projects to Deepen
- **Empathy Ledger**: From tool to platform. Story sovereignty for communities. Licensing model that generates revenue while keeping community ownership of data.
- **JusticeHub**: Centre of Excellence in ideation → active. Position as the national resource for youth justice reform through storytelling and systemic change.
- **PICC cluster** (Palm Island, Elders Room, Storm Stories, Photo Studio, Uncle Allan): Deepen. This is ACT's most mission-aligned work. Follow Elder guidance. Cultural protocols always.
- **Goods**: Activate the On-Country production model. Beds, products, economic sovereignty for marginalised producers. Maddi leads.
- **Double Disadvantage / QFCC**: Young people with disabilities in justice. Empathy Ledger as the evidence tool.

### Technology
- Living Intelligence platform operational — the AI understands the ecosystem well enough to surface patterns, flag risks, and support daily decision-making
- All projects connected through unified data layer (Supabase + Notion + comms)
- ALMA signals visible across every project

### Revenue
- Innovation Studio consulting: Steady income
- Empathy Ledger licensing: First paying clients
- The Harvest operations: Break-even by month 9
- Grant pipeline: Systematic, not scrambled

## Phase 2: Growth and Handover (2028-2031)

**Theme: Transfer power, scale what works**

### Community Ownership Transitions
- The Harvest: If still operating, transition to community cooperative. ACT becomes capacity partner, not operator.
- PICC: Palm Island community leads all decisions. ACT provides technical support only when asked.
- Goods: Producer collectives running their own supply chains. ACT facilitates connections but doesn't control.

### Models That Scale
- Empathy Ledger deployed in 5+ communities nationally. Each community owns their instance and data.
- JusticeHub Centre of Excellence publishing frameworks that other organisations adopt. ACT doesn't need to be in the room.
- The Harvest model documented and replicated in 2-3 other regions by other organisations. Open-source playbook.

### ACT Farm Matures
- Regenerated land supporting indigenous-led programs
- Food production flowing to local distribution
- Residency program for artists, makers, community builders
- Beginning conversations about land trust structure

### Team
- Ben and Nic no longer operational bottlenecks
- Community operators running The Harvest, Goods distribution, local programs
- ACT team focused on R&D, new partnerships, and supporting existing communities
- 2-3 additional team members in specialist roles (finance, community engagement, technology)

### Financial Independence
- Revenue from Empathy Ledger licensing, Innovation Studio, and The Harvest model covers operating costs
- Grant funding directed to community-owned projects, not ACT operations
- 40% profit share flowing to community ownership funds

## Phase 3: Obsolescence and Renewal (2031-2036)

**Theme: Hand over the keys**

### What ACT Becomes
- A philosophical movement, not an organisation
- A network of practitioners who share methods, not a hierarchy that controls projects
- A R&D lab for regenerative models, not a service provider

### Community Ownership
- ACT Farm transitions to Indigenous land trust with Jinibara partnership
- Empathy Ledger operated by a community-governed foundation
- JusticeHub frameworks are public infrastructure, maintained by sector
- Goods operates as independent social enterprise cooperative
- The Harvest model lives in multiple communities, none run by ACT

### The LCAA Legacy
- Listen, Curiosity, Action, Art is practiced by communities independently
- Monthly dinners continue without ACT organising them
- Stories are told by communities in their own voices
- Art emerges from community, not from ACT's programming

### What Remains
- The Farm as a gathering place (community-owned)
- A body of writing, methodology, and open-source tools
- A network of relationships
- Stories — thousands of stories owned by the communities who told them

## The Measure

We don't measure this in revenue, headcount, or reach.

We measure it in:
- **Communities that no longer need us**
- **Stories owned by the people who told them**
- **Land in community trust**
- **Economic systems that serve people, not extract from them**
- **Young people who see themselves as integral, not marginal**

---

## The Shift (from ACT_AS_MOVEMENT)

Moving from:
- **Normal** → ACT's normal
- **ACT's normal** → Witta community's normal
- **Witta's normal** → The world's normal
- **The world's normal** → Outside of limitation

Each phase expands what's possible. By 2036, the things ACT pioneered should be unremarkable — just how things are done.

## Inspiration

> "Our goal is not our continued presence, but the vibrant, autonomous ecosystems we help bring into being."

> "Does this make us more like a tractor's PTO — transferring power to communities who then drive their own future? Or does it make us the driver?"

*This is a living document. Review yearly. Challenge everything. The only failure is becoming indispensable.*
