# Sunday Reset — Feb 9, 2026

## Today's Intention

A reset day. Review what the AI has drafted, think about the week ahead, and decide what feels right.

---

## Focus

### 1. Review Planning Drafts in Obsidian
- Open decade vision → Does the 10-year arc feel true?
- Open 2026 yearly goals → Are these the right priorities?
- Open this week's plan → Does the week make sense?
- Open moon cycle review → Does this reflection format work?
- **Action:** Edit freely. Move anything that feels ready to working files. Delete what doesn't land.

### 2. Review Writing Drafts
- 8 essays sitting in drafts — which ones have energy?
- "Obsolescence as Liberation" — strongest philosophical piece, candidate for in-progress
- "Systems, Scale, and Meaningful Participation" — strong JusticeHub framing
- The On-Country production pieces — useful for Goods reactivation
- **Action:** Move 1-2 to in-progress if they feel alive

### 3. Prepare for the Week
- PICC Elders Room launch is the priority
- What does Narelle need from us?
- Any tech prep required for the premiere?
- Any travel logistics to confirm?

## LCAA Lens

- **Listen:** What are the Elders telling us about how this should unfold?
- **Curiosity:** What will we learn from the first real use of the planning system?
- **Action:** Review, edit, prepare. Light action, deep reflection.
- **Art:** The Elders Room itself is art — honouring stories from very long ago.

*Sunday is for spaciousness. Don't rush. The week will come.*
