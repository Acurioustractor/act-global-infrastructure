### Questions to Ask Standard Ledger
1. "Can you handle R&D for software + physical R&D (manufacturing, gardens)?"
2. "We have a dormant ACNC charity (A Kind Tractor LTD) — can you handle its annual compliance alongside the new Pty Ltd?"
3. "We want to automate as much bookkeeping as possible through Xero + AI — are you set up for that?"
4. "What's your flat fee for R&D tax claims? Is it really no success, no fee?"
5. "Can you set up two discretionary family trusts as part of the Pty Ltd package?"
6. "We'll have international R&D activities (world tour) — any issues claiming those?"
7. "What's the timeline from engagement to Pty Ltd being fully operational?"

## When to Consider Alternatives

| Want mid-tier firm with innovation focus | Grant Thornton |
| Need cross-border tax advice (World Tour) | Azure Group |

## Decision Status
