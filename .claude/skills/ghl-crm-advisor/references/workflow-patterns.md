# Workflow & Email Sequence Patterns

## Template Structure

```
[Sequence Name] - [Project]

Email 1 (Day 0): "[Subject Line]"
Subject: [Compelling subject with personalization]
Body:
Hi [FirstName],

[Opening - reference their action/interest]
[Value proposition]
[Social proof]
[Clear CTA with link]

[Signature]

---

Workflow Logic:
- If opened but didn't click → Send Email 2 immediately
- If clicked link → Tag "engaged", move to [stage]
- If replied → Tag "needs_response", notify team
- If unsubscribed → Remove, keep with tag "opted_out"
```

## Example: Volunteer Welcome Sequence (The Harvest)

Email 1 (Day 0): "Welcome to The Harvest"
Subject: Welcome to The Harvest family, [FirstName]!
Body:
Hi [FirstName],

Here's what happens next:
1. We'll review your application (24-48 hours)
2. You'll receive an orientation invite
3. You'll meet your volunteer coordinator

In the meantime, check out our volunteer stories: [link]

## Timing Best Practices

- Follow-up if no engagement: Day 3
- Value content: Day 7
- Urgency/deadline: Day 14
- Win-back: Day 30, 60, 90
- Never more than 2 emails/week
- Respect unsubscribes immediately
