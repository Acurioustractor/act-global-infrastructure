# ACT Brand Core

## Identity
- ACT is a regenerative innovation ecosystem partnering with marginalised—especially First Nations—communities to dismantle extractive systems.
- Legal structure: Dual-entity (charitable CLG + mission-locked trading arm) for grant eligibility and equitable profit-sharing.
- Core metaphor: Like a tractor's power take-off (PTO), we transfer resources, knowledge, and capacity to community-led initiatives—we hand over the keys.
- North star: Communities own their narratives, land, and economic futures. We design for our own obsolescence.

## Method (LCAA - Listen, Curiosity, Action, Art)
- **Listen**: Sit in silence to take in knowledge. Deep listening to place, people, history, and community voice—especially those often ignored. Pay attention to ancestral teachers.
- **Curiosity**: Think deeply, listen deeply, try to understand. Ask better questions, prototype, test, learn. Lean into the unknown with open minds and hearts.
- **Action**: We are makers who play and take chances, radically prototyping to form seedlings. Build, partner, deliver tangible outputs through innovative technologies, compelling stories, and immersive art.
- **Art**: Recognize art as the first form of revolution. Translate change into culture, meaning, and storytelling. Challenge the status quo, provoke critical thinking, inspire collective action.

## Core Values
- **Radical Humility**: We don't have all the answers, but we're cultivating solutions together.
- **Decentralised Power**: Communities lead; we support. Every tool has a sunset clause and "forkable" IP.
- **Creativity as Disruption**: Revolution starts with imagination. Art opens new possibilities.
- **Uncomfortable Truth-telling**: Name extractive systems and work to dismantle them.

## Promise
- Move toward shared governance and co-stewardship with community and partners.
- Social, cultural, environmental and economic value remains in community hands.
- 40% of profits flow to community ownership.
- The farm is a commons; the studio is the toolkit to practice care, accountability, and collective power.

## Outputs (Active "Seeds")
- **Empathy Ledger**: Ethical storytelling platform with consent frameworks and blockchain. Storytellers retain control and share in value created.
- **JusticeHub**: Open-source justice network where grassroots programs "fork" proven models, access AI insights, co-create governance.
- **Goods (Goods on Country)**: Circular-economy venture co-designing beds, mattresses, washing machines for remote communities while converting local waste.
- **Black Cockatoo Valley**: 150-acre (117 ha) regeneration estate combining eco-cottages, Indigenous land-care jobs, biodiversity credits to finance habitat restoration.
- **Harvest Shares / The Harvest**: CSA program and seasonal gatherings connected to the valley.
- **ACT Farm**: Home base where land care, learning, and art-making meet on Jinibara Country.
- **Art**: Artworks, exhibitions, residencies, artist profiles, commissions.

## Expressions (How We Show Up)
- R&D residencies (accommodation + prototyping on land)
- Workshops and events (regeneration, monitoring, learning-by-doing)
- June's Patch (healthcare worker wellbeing garden and food program)
- Harvest gatherings and community meals
- Conservation workshops and working bees
- Artist residencies and cultural programming

## Voice and Tone
- **Grounded yet Visionary**: Plant seeds today for forests tomorrow. Practical wisdom meets ambitious dreams.
- **Humble yet Confident**: We don't have all the answers, but we're cultivating solutions together.
- **Warm yet Challenging**: Let's get our hands dirty with the hard truths. Invite participation while confronting systems.
- **Poetic yet Clear**: Use metaphor to illuminate, not obscure. Every story is a seed that can grow into change.
- **Place-first and community-first**: Emphasize relationships, reciprocity, and Indigenous sovereignty.
- **Avoid**: Overclaiming, extractive framing, luxury positioning, high-volume commercial language, glossy corporate speak.

## One-liner Identity Options
- A regenerative innovation ecosystem partnering with marginalised communities to dismantle extractive systems.
- A regenerative innovation studio stewarding a working farm on Jinibara Country.
- Cultivating seeds of justice, art, and shared governance from a working farm.
- An innovation studio growing co-stewardship through land, story, and action.
- Like a tractor sharing its power take-off—we transfer resources, knowledge, and capacity to community-led initiatives.

## Farm Metaphor System
- **Seeds**: Active projects that need time, water, and attention
- **Soil**: Our knowledge network and community wisdom
- **Seasons**: Natural cycles of growth, harvest, and rest
- **Harvest**: Shared value that feeds the community
- **Fields**: Domains where we cultivate change (justice innovation, storytelling, land care, art, shared governance)
- **Tractor/PTO**: We provide capacity-building, knowledge-sharing, flexible resourcing, and network weaving—then communities drive forward

## Visual Language (if designing)
- **Color Palette**: Earthy greens and browns, warm neutrals, off-white backgrounds (Stone 50-900 + Emerald for conservation themes)
- **Imagery**: Organic textures, farm or valley imagery, seedbed/field motifs, Black Cockatoo Valley drone photos, threatened species habitat

## Impact Metrics Framework
- **Community Ownership**: Communities independently replicating models, Indigenous-majority governance on place-based projects
- **Regenerative Outcomes**: Land under conservation, jobs created in marginalised communities, waste reduction through circular economy
- **Narrative Sovereignty**: Stories protected through Empathy Ledger, storytellers earning from narratives, Traditional knowledge respected and compensated
- **Systems Change**: Justice models reducing recidivism, open-source tools adopted, extractive systems replaced with regenerative ones
- **Joy Assessments**: Qualitative measures of agency, capacity, wellbeing alongside quantitative data
