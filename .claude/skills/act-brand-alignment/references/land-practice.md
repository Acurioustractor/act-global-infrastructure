# Land and Practice (Black Cockatoo Valley)

## Land
- Black Cockatoo Valley is a 150-acre property on Jinibara lands near Witta, Queensland.
- Views to the Mary River; creeks and forest down to Elaman Creek.
- Threatened species habitat; conservation comes first.

## Practice
- Low-impact, limited-volume activity; no extractive tourism.
- Premium, small-group residencies and workshops that fund restoration.
- Revenue is reinvested into habitat care, weed management, and monitoring.
- Long-term goal is community co-stewardship ("beautiful obsolescence").

## Farm expressions
- R&D residencies (accommodation + prototyping on land).
- Workshops and events (regeneration, monitoring, learning-by-doing).
- June's Patch (healthcare worker wellbeing, garden and food program).
- Accommodation pathways (current and future, conservation-first).

## Guardrails for copy
- Always center conservation-first framing.
- Emphasize care, reciprocity, and learning with Country.
- Avoid language that implies high-volume commercial retreating.
