# ACT Brand Alignment

## When to Use
- Writing/editing ANY ACT content (web, marketing, grants, reports)
- Designing UI, visual assets, or brand materials
- Planning information architecture
- Creating content models or data structures
- Reviewing copy for voice/tone alignment

## Quick Reference

### Identity
A Curious Tractor is a regenerative innovation ecosystem partnering with marginalised—especially First Nations—communities to dismantle extractive systems. Like a tractor's power take-off, we transfer resources to community-led initiatives. We hand over the keys.

### Method (LCAA)
Listen → Curiosity → Action → Art

### Values
- Radical Humility (no saviors)
- Decentralised Power (communities lead)
- Creativity as Disruption (revolution through imagination)
- Truth-telling (name extractive systems)

### Promise
40% of profits flow to community ownership. We design for our own obsolescence.

## Project Scope Mapping

| Project | Focus | Load |
|---------|-------|------|
| Hub (act.place) | ACT as ecosystem, LCAA, partnerships | `brand-core.md` |
| ACT Farm / BCV | Land practice, conservation, residencies | `land-practice.md` |
| JusticeHub | Justice innovation, forkable models | `projects-ecosystem.md` |
| Empathy Ledger | Ethical storytelling, consent, sovereignty | `projects-ecosystem.md` |
| The Harvest | CSA, community gatherings | `land-practice.md` |
| Goods on Country | Circular economy, waste-to-product | `projects-ecosystem.md` |
| Art | Art as revolution, cultural production | `projects-ecosystem.md` |

## Voice Guardrails

**DO:**
- Farm metaphor: seeds, harvest, cultivating, soil, seasons, fields
- Community ownership, co-stewardship, Indigenous sovereignty
- "Designing for obsolescence" / "handing over the keys"
- Name Jinibara Country when referencing the land
- 40% profit-sharing commitment

**DON'T:**
- Overclaim ("world-leading," "revolutionary")
- Extractive, luxury, or commercial language
- Frame communities as beneficiaries (they are co-owners)
- Corporate jargon or glossy marketing speak
- Imply permanence (we design for obsolescence)

## Visual Language
- Palette: Stone 50-900 + Emerald accents
- Typography: Geist Sans
