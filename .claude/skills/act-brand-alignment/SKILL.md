# ACT Brand Alignment

## Overview
This skill ensures all ACT work—whether for the main hub, ACT Farm, Black Cockatoo Valley, JusticeHub, Empathy Ledger, The Harvest, Goods on Country, Art, or partner projects—stays aligned with:
- ACT's regenerative innovation mission and PTO (power take-off) metaphor
- LCAA methodology (Listen, Curiosity, Action, Art)
- Core values: Radical Humility, Decentralised Power, Creativity as Disruption, Truth-telling
- Conservation-first, community-led, Indigenous sovereignty principles
- Dual-entity structure (CLG charity + trading arm) and 40% profit-sharing commitment
- Farm metaphor system (seeds, soil, seasons, harvest, fields)
- Voice: Grounded yet visionary, humble yet confident, warm yet challenging, poetic yet clear

## When to Use This Skill
- Writing or editing ANY ACT-related content (web pages, marketing, grants, reports)
- Designing UI, visual assets, or brand materials
- Planning information architecture or navigation
- Creating content models or data structures
- Drafting messaging for specific projects while maintaining ecosystem coherence
- Ensuring cross-project consistency and appropriate linking
- Reviewing copy for voice/tone alignment
- Planning project launches or communications

## Quick Workflow

### 1. Identify Scope
**Hub Site (act.place)**
- Focus: ACT as ecosystem, LCAA method, all seeds/outputs, partnerships
- References: brand-core.md, projects-ecosystem.md, content-structure.md

**ACT Farm / Black Cockatoo Valley**
- Focus: Land practice, conservation-first, residencies, June's Patch, Harvest
- References: brand-core.md, land-practice.md, content-structure.md

**JusticeHub**
- Focus: Justice innovation, forkable models, community courts, impact data
- References: brand-core.md, projects-ecosystem.md (JusticeHub section)

**Empathy Ledger**
- Focus: Ethical storytelling, consent frameworks, narrative sovereignty, value-sharing
- References: brand-core.md, projects-ecosystem.md (Empathy Ledger section)

**The Harvest**
- Focus: CSA, community gatherings, local stewardship, accessibility
- References: brand-core.md, land-practice.md, projects-ecosystem.md

**Goods on Country**
- Focus: Circular economy, remote community co-design, waste-to-product
- References: brand-core.md, projects-ecosystem.md (Goods section)

**Art**
- Focus: Art as revolution, artist support, cultural production
- References: brand-core.md, projects-ecosystem.md (Art section)

### 2. Load References
**Always load**: `references/brand-core.md` (identity, LCAA, values, voice)

**Conditionally load**:
- Land/farm content → `references/land-practice.md`
- Project details or cross-linking → `references/projects-ecosystem.md`
- Page structure or IA → `references/content-structure.md`

### 3. Apply Voice Guardrails
**Do:**
- Use farm metaphor language: seeds, harvest, cultivating, soil, seasons, fields
- Emphasize community ownership, co-stewardship, Indigenous sovereignty
- Frame in LCAA terms when describing process
- Mention "designing for obsolescence" / "handing over the keys" / "PTO metaphor"
- Be specific about conservation-first approach for land content
- Include 40% profit-sharing commitment where relevant
- Use one-liner identities verbatim when introducing ACT
- Name Jinibara Country when referencing the land
- Highlight dual-entity structure when discussing funding/sustainability
- Apply voice attributes: grounded yet visionary, humble yet confident, warm yet challenging, poetic yet clear

**Don't:**
- Overclaim or use superlatives ("world-leading," "revolutionary" without backing)
- Use extractive, luxury, or high-volume commercial language
- Frame communities as beneficiaries rather than co-owners
- Gloss over hard truths or systemic challenges
- Use corporate jargon or glossy marketing speak
- Imply permanence (we design for obsolescence)
- Separate profit from purpose

### 4. Deliver with CTAs and Links
- Use clear, direct CTAs: "Get in touch," "Learn more," "Visit [project]," "Join CSA"
- Cross-link to project sites when mentioning outputs
- Always link with context: explain what project does BEFORE linking
- Respect each project's distinct brand while showing ecosystem connection
- Include registry feeds where appropriate (Empathy Ledger, JusticeHub, Harvest, Goods)

## Core Principles to Embed

### Identity
A Curious Tractor is a regenerative innovation ecosystem partnering with marginalised—especially First Nations—communities to dismantle extractive systems. Like a tractor's power take-off, we transfer resources, knowledge, and capacity to community-led initiatives. We hand over the keys.

### Method (LCAA)
Every ACT project follows Listen → Curiosity → Action → Art:
- **Listen**: Deep listening to place, people, history (especially those often ignored)
- **Curiosity**: Ask better questions, prototype, test, learn with open minds
- **Action**: Build tangible outputs through innovation, story, and art
- **Art**: Challenge status quo, provoke thinking, inspire collective action

### Values
- **Radical Humility**: Cultivating solutions together, no saviors
- **Decentralised Power**: Communities lead, we support. Every tool has a sunset clause.
- **Creativity as Disruption**: Revolution starts with imagination
- **Truth-telling**: Name extractive systems, work to dismantle them

### Promise
Social, cultural, environmental, and economic value stays in community hands. 40% of profits flow to community ownership. We design for our own obsolescence.

### Visual Language (if designing)
- Earthy palette: Stone 50-900 + Emerald accents
- Imagery: BCV drone photos, threatened species, hands in soil, collaborative gathering, Country
- Typography: Geist Sans (digital), clean hierarchy
- Layout: Spacious, quiet, conservation-first framing
- Motifs: Seeds, cockatoos, regenerative farming, seedbed patterns
